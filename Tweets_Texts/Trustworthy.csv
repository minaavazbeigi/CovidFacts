46,"the first covid-19 vaccine to go into any american arms outside of a trial â and the first to be fully approved by the food and drug administration ââ is pfizerâs mrna vaccine, which was designed and developed by the german biotech company biontech. here, we give a rundown of basic facts about the vaccine and an overview of how it works.
quick summary
vaccine name: bnt162b2, marketed as comirnaty
design type: mrna
dose number: 2, 21 days apart, with aâ third dose recommended for certain immunocompromised people. a third âboosterâ dose is also recommended for people 50 years of age and older and other groups at increased risk; all adultsâ mayâ receive one.
efficacy: 91%â efficacyâ in preventing symptomatic covid-19 inâ people 16 years of age or olderâ a week or more after receipt of the second dose.
safety: no serious safety concerns reported other than some rare allergic reactions and a likely, but rare, association with heart inflammation. the shots routinely elicit a fairly strong temporary reaction in many people that can include injection site pain, fatigue, headache and chills.
expected dose availability: worldwide, up to 50 million doses, or enough for approximately 25 million people, by the end of 2020, with up to 1.3 billion doses expected in 2021.
timeline: first doses were administered in december 2020â to prioritized populations, following the fdaâs emergency use authorization on dec. 11.
operation warp speed involvement: no support for the trials or research and development, but the u.s. government inked a $1.95 billion deal in july as part of ows to buy 100 million doses. inâ decemberâ andâ februaryâ the u.s. announced agreements to purchase another 100 million doses each, for a total of 300 million doses to be delivered by the end of july 2021.
storage considerations: ultracold freezer temperatures of -80âºc to -60âºc (-112âºf to -76âºf)â for long-term storage,â withâ up to two weeks at standard freezer temperatures; after thawing, undiluted vaccine vials can be stored at refrigerator temperatures for up to a month.â 
the pfizer/biontech vaccine is the first covid-19 vaccine authorized for use in the u.s. and theâ firstâ to be fully approved by the fda.â  the companies released promising interim results from a phase 3 trial on nov. 9, and on nov. 18 announced an efficacy of 95% in preventing disease.
two days later, the company submitted its application to the fda to receive an emergency use authorization, or eua, for its vaccine in people 16 years of age and older. the fda conducted a thorough review â including an analysis of the raw data â of the vaccineâs safety and efficacy, and issued an eua on dec. 11.
a day prior to the fdaâs authorization, an outside panel of experts advising the agency also backed the vaccineâ in a 17 to 4 vote, with one abstention, that based on the evidence available, âthe benefits of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 16 years of age and older.â
based on additional clinical trial data from adolescents, the fdaâ amendedâ its eua for the vaccine on may 10 to include teens ages 12 to 15. the agency alsoâ revisedâ the eua on aug. 12 to allow for third doses of the vaccine in certain immunocompromised people.
on aug. 23, the fda grantedâ full approvalâ toâ the vaccine for people 16 years of age and older. the vaccineâ remainsâ available under emergency use to childrenâ as young as 12â and as a third dose to select immunocompromised people. a distinct pediatric version of the vaccine, with one-third as much mrna, is authorized for children ages 5 through 11. for more on that vaccine, see âa guide to pfizer/biontechâs pediatric covid-19 vaccine for kids 5-11.â
the fda has also authorized third dose âboostersâ for non-immunocompromised people. after initially restrictingâ eligibility to people 65 years of age and older and adults at higher risk, the agencyâ expandedâ booster access to all adults on nov. 19. a cdc advisory committeeâ concludedâ thatâ anyone 50 years of age and older or with risk factors âshouldâ receive one,â while adults below 50â without risk factors âmayâ receive one.
âstreamlining the eligibility criteria and making booster doses available to all individuals 18 years of age and older will also help to eliminate confusion about who may receive a booster dose and ensure booster doses are available to all who may need one,â said dr. peter marks, director of the fdaâs center for biologics evaluation and research, in a press release announcing the expansion.
pfizer/biontech q&a
what is in the vaccine and how does it work?
as with most other covid-19 vaccine designs, the pfizer/biontech mrna vaccine works by triggering an immune response against the spike protein of the sars-cov-2 virus, which sits on the surface of the virus and is what the virus uses to enter cells.
the vaccine is made of modified messenger rna, or mrna, wrapped in a special blend of fatty molecules known as lipid nanoparticles. the mrna provides instructions for cells to make their own spike proteins, prompting the body to generate protective antibodies and activate t cells. the lipids help deliver the rna into cells and prevent it from being degraded too quickly.
as the centers for disease control and prevention has explained, there is no way to catch covid-19 from this type of vaccine because the vaccine is not made of a virus. and because the mrna from the vaccine doesnât enter the nucleus â the part of the cell that houses dna â it âdoes not affect or interact with a personâs dna,â contrary to some online rumors.
how was the vaccine developed?
german company biontech designed multiple mrna vaccine candidates after the genetic sequence of the sars-cov-2 virus became public in january 2020 and partnered with pfizer in march 2020.
early phase clinical trials showed that two leading mrna designs triggered neutralizing antibody responses that were better than those from people recovering from natural covid-19 infection, with no serious adverse events.â 
but one candidate â bnt162b2, which prompts cells to make a full-length spike protein â did so with fewer side effects than the other. based on the trial results and preclinical tests â in animals, the companies decided to move forward to a combined phase 2/3 randomized controlled trial testing two 30 microgram doses of bnt162b2 on volunteers.
the phase 2/3 trial began in late july 2020, ultimately enrolling around 46,000â people in the u.s., argentina, brazil, germany, south africa and turkey. enrollment was expanded past the 30,000 initial target in september 2020 to include people infected with hiv, hepatitis b and hepatitis c, and to add teens as young as 16 years old. in october 2020, the age requirement was lowered to 12 years old. because of the limited data available on this population at the time of submission, however, pfizer did not ask to include the 12- to 15-year-old age group in its original eua request.
pfizer is conductingâ additional studiesâ in childrenâ below the age of 12.
how effective is the vaccine?
in theâ updatedâ trial resultsâ reported to the fda for full approval, the pfizer/biontech vaccine was 91% effective in preventing symptomatic disease at least a week after the second dose in people 16 years of age and older.
thisâ does notâ meanâ that the vaccine works 91% of the time or that 9% of vaccinated people will fall ill with covid-19. instead, as emory university biostatisticianâ natalie deanâ and the world health organizationâ haveâ explained, the percentage refers to a relative reduction in risk, such that a vaccinated person is 91% less likely to get sick compared with an unvaccinated person.
in the updated analysis, which included around 20,000 participants each in the vaccine and placebo groups, there were 833 symptomatic covid-19 cases in the placebo group and 77 in the vaccine group.
pfizerâ previouslyâ reportedâ an efficacy of 95% in preventing disease in people 16 years of age and older, based on 162 cases of symptomatic covid-19 in the placebo group and eight in the vaccine group. it was this data that served as the basis of the fdaâs initial eua for the vaccine in december 2020.â 
according to the fdaâsâ summaryâ explaining its approval decision, vaccine efficacy for the updated trial was similar across a variety of demographics, including gender, ethnic groups and those at high risk of severe covid-19.
protection against severe disease was also very high. depending on the case definition for severe covid-19, the vaccine wasâ eitherâ 95% or 100% effective in the updated trial.
vaccine efficacy,â which is the metric measured in a randomized controlled trial,â isâ differentâ from vaccine effectiveness, which refers to the real-world performance of the vaccine, as measured in observational studies. vaccines may not do quite as well in a wider population outside the idealized conditions of a trial.
efficacy figures also only reflect the vaccineâs performance after a certain amount of time and against the type of virus circulating in the population at the time of testing. in the case of the pfizer/biontech vaccine, that did not include the highly contagious delta variant,â butâ did includeâ some locations where theâ beta variantâ was prevalent; the period of follow-up wasâ up to around six monthsâ after receiving a second dose.
at the same time, observational studies used to estimate effectiveness are more prone to bias compared with randomized controlled trials.
since the vaccineâs rollout, numerous observational studies have demonstrated the pfizer/biontech vaccineâs effectiveness in the real world,â includingâ against the delta variant, although there may be a decline in protection against infection and mild disease compared with previous viral variants.â 
aâ studyâ published in theâ new england journal of medicineâ in july, for example, found that the two-dose vaccine was 88.0% effective in preventing symptomatic disease with delta in the u.k., down from 93.7% against the previously dominant alpha variant.
otherâ studiesâ fromâ theâ u.s. also suggest a moderate decrease in the vaccineâs ability to prevent infection, either due to waning immunity over time, the delta variant or some combination of the two.â 
in aâ study of new york residents, about half of whom were immunized with the pfizer/biontech vaccine, vaccine protection against infection fell from 92% to 75% between early may and late july. another study of nursing home residents from across the u.s. found that the effectiveness of the pfizer/biontech vaccine against infection declined from 74% in the pre-delta era to 53% with delta.
there isâ littleâ sign, however, of a similar drop in protection against serious disease, hospitalization or death. in the new york study, vaccine protection against hospitalization remained at 90% or higher. another evaluation, which pulled information from across 18 u.s. states, found the pfizer/biontech and moderna vaccines stayed 84% to 86% effective in preventing hospitalization for 24 weeks.
it remains unknown how long vaccine protection lasts. for some people who are immunocompromised,â data suggestâ that two doses may be insufficient and those individualsâ might benefitâ from an additional dose.
for people who are healthy, pfizer is conductingâ additional studiesâ to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a third âboosterâ dose of its vaccine. in late august, the companyâ announced positive results of giving a booster â an increase in neutralizing antibodies with similar side effects to the two-dose regimen.
in september, the fdaâ authorized a booster dose, given at least six months after the initial two-dose series, for the elderly and other populations at increased risk.
in october, pfizerâ releasedâ clinical trial data showing a booster reduced the chance of falling ill with covid-19 by 95.6% compared with those who were fully vaccinated but had not received a booster. the fdaâ expandedâ booster eligibility to all adults in mid-november.
evidenceâ suggestsâ people vaccinated with the pfizer/biontech vaccine who become infected with the coronavirus can pass it on to others, although they areâ less likelyâ to do so compared with unvaccinated people.
how safe is the vaccine?
in clinical trials and in subsequent safety monitoring, the pfizer/biontech vaccine has been shown to be very safe.â 
while many people experience unpleasant side effects,â the vaccine only very rarely appears to cause more serious problems.â 
thisâ includesâ serious allergic reactions, such asâ anaphylaxis, and an increased risk of inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or its surrounding tissue (pericarditis). both of these adverse events, while potentially dangerous, are uncommon and treatable.
anaphylaxis refers to a life-threatening reaction that usually occurs within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergic substance.â all vaccination sites are equippedâ toâ dealâ with allergic reactions.
peopleâ getting the vaccineâ should be prepared forâ irksomeâ side effects,â includingâ pain, redness and swelling at the site of injection, as well as fatigue, headache,â muscle pain,â chills,â joint painâ and fever.
according to theâ clinicalâ trial data, these types of reactions were relatively common and tended to be more frequent and severe in younger people.
the only people the fda saysâ should notâ receive the pfizer/biontech vaccine are those who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or one of its ingredients. the cdcâ advisesâ not getting the pfizer/biontech vaccine if you have had any kind of immediate reaction, even if not severe, to a dose of the vaccine or one of itsâ ingredients, such as polyethylene glycol.
the agency alsoâ recommendsâ consulting with your physician if you have ever had an immediate allergic reaction to other vaccines or injectable therapies.
data presented to the cdc advisory committeeâ showedâ a rate of 5.0 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses of the pfizer/biontech vaccine, as of july 31, which isâ slightly higher than 1 to 2 per million instances that occur with other vaccines. the crude estimated frequency of anaphylaxis, as reported in the fdaâsâ summary accompanying the approval, is 6.0 cases per million doses.
in late june, the cdcâsâ advisory committee on immunization practicesâ concluded there is a âlikely associationâ between covid-19 mrna vaccination and myocarditis and pericarditisâ in teens and young adults.
as of nov. 10, the agency says there have beenâ 1,793â preliminary reports of either condition in peopleâ 12 through 29 years of ageâ following immunization with any covid-19 vaccine.
health officials haveâ emphasizedâ that the potential vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis cases are rare and the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. early evidence, acipâ said, suggests these myocarditis cases are less severe than typical ones. the cdc has alsoâ notedâ that most patients who were treated âresponded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better.â
according to an fdaâ q&a, the agency has concluded that the safety surveillance data âdemonstrate increased risksâ of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with the pfizer/biontech vaccine.
in its approvalâ summary, the fda said the reporting rates for confirmed cases of myocarditis or pericarditis are higher in males under the age of 40 and are highest in male teens 12 to 17 years of age, at approximately 65 cases per million doses administered. the conditions are also more common after the second dose and within a week of vaccination. âalthough some cases of vaccine-associated myocarditis/pericarditis required intensive care support,â the fda summary reads, âavailable data from short-term follow up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with conservative management.â
the agency conducted its own benefit-risk assessment andâ concludedâ that even in a âworst-caseâ scenario, in which myocarditis and pericarditis cases were more frequent than currently observed, the vaccine was less effective than expected and covid-19 transmission was low, the benefits of vaccination would outweigh the risks.
a study from israel,â publishedâ in theâ new england journal of medicineâ on aug. 25, similarly identified vaccination with the pfizer/biontech vaccine as being associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis, at the rate of 2.7 additional cases per 100,000 people. but that risk was still much lower than the risk of the same condition in people who contracted the coronavirus, which was at a rate of 11 additional cases per 100,000 people.
the fda isâ requiringâ pfizer to conduct six studies to better understand the risk of the inflammatory heart conditions after vaccination.â the cdc is alsoâ conductingâ its own survey to investigate potential long-term effects.
why does the vaccine need to be kept so cold?
the extreme cold is necessary to keep the highly sensitive lipid-encapsulated rna molecules from degrading. logistically, this cold chain requirement poses an extra hurdle in distributing the vaccine, since many potential vaccination sites lack the appropriate ultracold freezers and may not have a ready source of dry ice.
pfizer has tried to mitigate some of these challenges by creating specialized âthermal shippersâ for its vaccine that will maintain ultracold temperatures for up to 10 days if unopened and can store vials for as long as a month if refilled every five days with dry ice.
on feb. 25, the fda also began allowing the vaccines to be shipped or stored at regular freezer temperatures for up to two weeks, following data showing that the doses would remain stable under such conditions. in may, the agency extended the time undiluted vials could be kept in a refrigerator to a month, up from the original five days.
rival company moderna, which also used an mrna design for its covid-19 vaccine candidate, also requires freezing temperatures, but they are less severe, due to differences in the particular lipid nanoparticles used. the company announced in november that its vaccine should remain stable long-term at standard freezer temperatures and should last for 30 days in a refrigerator.

48,"researchers use genomic sequencing â not the clinical tests used to diagnose patients with covid-19 â to identify and track specific variants of the novel coronavirus, sars-cov-2, including the highly contagious delta variant. but viral posts try to deny the existence of the variant by misleadingly claiming there is âno âdelta variantâ test.â

the delta variant of the novel coronavirus â now the dominant version of the virus in the u.s. â has presented additional challenges as the country tries to mitigate the spread of covid-19. the highly contagious variantâ is responsible for a surge in outbreaks across the country, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates. vaccinesâ still protectâ against the variant, especiallyâ against serious illness and death, but may be less effective against delta compared to other forms of the virus.
yet false and misleading claims have recently sought to not only cast doubt on the seriousness of the variant, but question its existence.

one such meme shared on facebook more than 12,000 times misleadingly asks, âsince there is no âdelta variantâ test, how exactly are people being diagnosed with the âdelta variantâ?â
the same question was presented in a july 26 tweet shared by thousands that was posted by errol webber, a film producer and republican who unsuccessfully ran for congress in california last year. similar posts have been shared hundreds of times each.
adding to the misperception, at a white house press briefing july 30, emerald robinson, a reporter for the conservative outlet newsmax, asked, of the delta variant, âhow do you test, when â that itâs the dominant strain in the area, when people just test whether theyâre covid positive?â
white house principal deputy press secretary karine jean-pierre, seemingly perplexed,â saidâ âwe donât test itâ and that âwe listen to public health and scientists, and they tell us that itâs the delta variant.â
on twitter, robinson â who has nearly 400,000 followers ââ has since misleadinglyâ claimedâ that âthe biden administration is unable to provide any proof that delta variant is realâ andâ laterâ that the administration âhas no idea how to test for the delta variant.â
but the various posts trying to cast doubt on the validity of the delta variant betray a lack of understanding of how variants are being identified and tracked. there is testing to identify delta and other variants, but itâs more sophisticated than the routine clinical testing â often by polymerase chain reaction, orâ pcr, tests â used to simply determine whether someone has covid-19.
dr. benjamin pinsky, an associate professor of pathology and medicine at stanford university, told us in a phone interview that itâs worth first noting that âall the diagnostic tests are capable of detecting the delta variant â they just donât distinguish it from different lineages.â in other words, the pcr tests do detect the delta variant as sars-cov-2.
identifying and tracking specific variants, however, requires additional analysis.

to do that, scientists use a process called genomic sequencing. as the centers for disease control and prevention explains, sequencing is a way to decode the genes of a virus to better understand factors such as its spread and evolution.
john everett, who helps conducts such research at penn medicineâ to understand the virusâ presence in the delaware valley, explained it this way: âresearch institutions, including penn, study samples collected from the community by sequencing viral genomes in those samples. we identify mutations in the genomes, compared to the original wuhan strain, where groupings of specific mutations are used to define viral variants or lineages.â
âwe track the relative rise and fall of different lineages which we can break apart by zip code to build a picture of how the different lineages are spreading in our area,â everett, the bioinformatics director for the university of pennsylvania lab group behind the research, told us by email.
the groupâs data show how the delta variant has rapidly become the main lineage identified in most samples tested from the university of pennsylvania health system.
some findings done through pcr tests can provide insights into the suspected lineage present. for example, the alpha variant â first identified in the united kingdom in september 2020 â caused pcr failures involving the virusâ s gene, which codes for the surface spike protein, because of the variantâs mutations.
the phenomenon of variants causing test issues is expected, everett said, which is why pcr tests check against âmultiple regions of the viral genome.â thatâs âanother reason why surveillance is important â to identify mutations in the community which may interfere with tests and adjust the tests as needed,â he said.
dr. marie-louise landry, director of the clinical virology laboratory at yale new haven hospital, noted that the s gene issue âwas only suggestive of alphaâ since it was only one of the characteristic mutations of alpha. sequencing the whole genome, she told us by email, is still needed to confirm that it was indeed the alpha variant.
pinsky, who is also medical director of the clinical virology laboratory for stanford health care, said his lab runs a second, different pcr test on samples that are positive for sars-cov-2 to look for specific mutations that are seen in variants of concern and variants of interest prior to sequencing.
for the delta variant, pinsky said, whatâs known as the l452r mutation is often a telling sign: about 94% of the samples analyzed by his lab that show that mutation are proven to be delta once sequenced, he said. moreover, about 90% of all positive samples recently sequenced by his lab are delta, he said.
âdelta is certainly not a hoax,â pinsky said.
and while some of the viral posts online suggest patients are being âdiagnosedâ with the delta variant, all the experts we consulted said that patients would not be typically informed of the lineage identified ââ though, in areas with predominantly delta transmission, patients may be able to make inferences.
dr. atul butte noted to us in an email that sequencing analyses âare not clinical tests.â
âthese sequences are used for public health tracking and epidemiology,â said butte, a university of california, san francisco pediatrics and epidemiology professor who also directs the universityâs bakar computational health sciences institute. âwe wouldnât deliver any different medical care right now, based on whether one variant is present or another.â

67,"in the first tv ads of the runoff campaign that could help decide the balance of the senate, republican sen. david perdue warned his opponent would âradically change america,â while democratic challenger jon ossoff accused his opponent of downplaying the coronavirus.
the ad from perdue makes the misleading claims that ossoff would âdefund policeâ and provide âvoting rights for illegal immigrants.â ossoff has repeatedly said he does not support defunding police. and while he supports providing a pathway to citizenship to some 11 million immigrants currently in the country illegally, he does not support voting rights for noncitizens.
ossoffâs ad offers similar side-by-side comments from perdue and president donald trump that the ad contends show perdue âignored the medical experts, downplayed the crisis and left us unprepared.â
weâll leave it to readers to decide for themselves if perdueâs comments did that, but some of the comments highlighted in the ad came early in the year at a time when medical experts were making similar comments. and perdue made other comments warning about the seriousness of the virus and reinforcing centers for disease control and prevention recommendations to reduce the spread of the virus.
perdueâs ad
theâ first tv ad of the runoff from the perdue campaign begins with a clip of senate minority leader chuck schumer celebrating after joe biden was projected the winner of the presidential race, telling a crowd in new york, ânow we take georgia, then we change america.â

if democrats were to flip the two senate seats in georgiaâs january runoff elections â perdue vs. ossoff and republican sen. kelly loeffler vs. democrat raphael warnock â democrats would control both houses of congress and the presidency.
âyou heard him,â the adâs narrator says. âchuck schumer is trying to use georgia to take the senate majority and radically change america. the schumer, pelosi, ossoff change? defund police. voting rights for illegal immigrants. washington, d.c. as the 51st state.â
thatâs a distortion of ossoffâs positions. ossoff has repeatedly said he does not support defunding police.
for example, in a sirius xm radio interview on sept. 11, ossoff said, âi oppose defunding the police and i think frankly, itâs a counterproductive and foolish way of characterizing what i think for some folks is a desire to reform police.â
in an interview on wsb radio on june 11, ossoff reiterated, âno, the answer is not to defund police. the answer is to reform police. and the answer is to demilitarize police. far too many local police departments are heavily equipped with armored vehicles and military equipment, and when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.â
the perdue campaign points to comments ossoff made in a radio interview in june: âyou have to have national standards for the use of force, and yeah, youâve got to be able to hold individual officers and entire departments accountable, and there also has to be funding for those departments on the line.â (starting at the 19:39 mark.)
the ossoff campaign says that ossoff was talking about supplemental police funding, and that ossoffâs position is similar to that of biden, who in june told cbs news, âno, i donât support defunding the police. i support conditioning federal aid to police, based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness. and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community.â
as we have written, there is no agreed upon definition for the term âdefund the police.â some police critics, who believe there is systemic racism in law enforcement, really do want to abolish police forces and replace them with other forms of community safety entities. others advocate shifting some money and functions away from police departments to social service agencies.
ossoff told the atlanta journal-constitution in august that he agrees with bidenâs position of tying federal funds for law enforcement agencies to meeting certain standards, including whether they can âdemonstrate they can protect the community.â
the ad also distorts ossoffâs position when it says he supports âvoting rights for illegal immigrants.â ossoffâs campaign told us he does not, and the perdue campaign didnât provide any evidence that he does.
the perdue campaign points to bidenâs support for âproviding a roadmap to citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrantsâ currently in the u.s., including the so-called dreamers who arrived in the u.s. illegally as children. a bipartisan immigration bill that sought to do the same thing passed the senate in 2013 with the support of 14 republicans, including sens. lindsey graham and marco rubio, who co-sponsored the bill. ossoffâs policy similarly calls for creating âa path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who are already here and otherwise follow the law.â
but thatâs different from allowing âvoting rights for illegal immigrants.â as we have written, it would likely take more than a dozen years under such legislation for immigrants to gain full citizenship, and voting rights. but they would then be citizens, not âillegal immigrants.â ossoffâs campaign says he opposes voting rights for noncitizens.
the ad is correct that ossoff supports statehood for washington, d.c., but itâs not clear that statehood for d.c. could be accomplished even with a simple majority in the senate. under senate rules, legislation can be blocked if it fails to receive the 60 votes necessary to end debate and move to a vote.
âany effort to get dc statehood would be filibustered,â norm ornstein, a congressional expert at the american enterprise institute, told us via email. âso the answer is that it would first require a change in the rules of the senate to reform or end the filibuster, which is not going to happen with only 50 democrats â at least not for some time. it could happen, if [senate majority leader mitch] mcconnellâs republicans used the filibuster to block everything â including covid relief, infrastructure, and every other biden initiative. but not for quite a while, and no sure thing at all.â
ossoffâs ad
the latest ad from the ossoff campaign mirrors one it has been running since the summer, accusing perdue of downplaying the coronavirus crisis. the runoff ad, called âecho,â is updated to pair similar quotes from perdue and trump to make the case that perdue âignored the medical experts, downplayed the crisis and left us unprepared.â

weâll just focus on the quotes attributed to perdue. the quotes are accurate; however, they are misleadingly juxtaposed with a chart showing the rising covid-19 death count. some of perdueâs comments were made early in the pandemic, long before the corresponding number of deaths reached the levels shown in the ad.
the first two quotes come from an interview perdue did with the valleyâs morning news podcast â a georgia programâ  â on march 11. the bolded parts of the interview are included in the ad.
perdue, march 11: itâs a balance between being precautionary and overreacting. and i think we have to realize that the risk of this virus in the united states right now still remains low. and the mortality rate is still being determined. the normal mortality rate of the normal flu is well under 1%. this so far is over 1%, but you know, so far, very, very few people have been exposed to it in the united states. [â¦] so i think weâre doing what we should do right now. i donât want to see america panic and overreact. but i do think itâs good for us to be precautionary and just take care of ourselves relative to whether we think weâre getting sick or have been exposed or anything like that.
perdue went on to say that âthe authorities are not taking this lightly. weâre presuming the worst and preparing for the worst. but at the same time, weâre hopeful this thing will burn itself out before we see a dramatic increase in the numbers here.â
the perdue campaign also noted that in this interview, perdue reiterated cdc guidance: âif youâre elderly or have a respiratory illness, be discretionary and stay away from large crowds. use hand sanitizers, wash your hands frequently, try to stay away from people who are sick. and if you are sick, stay home. and if it feels like itâs getting serious, call a doctor, donât go run to the emergency room right away but call a physician and get advice.â
to put these comments in the context of the moment, the day before the interview, there were about 1,500 covid-19 cases in the u.s., with about 37 deaths, according to the covid tracking project. at that time, the new york times reported 17 cases in georgia, and no deaths.
in comments on feb. 29, less than two weeks before perdueâs interview, dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, said in an interview on nbcâs âtodayâ show that the risk from covid-19 âis still low,â and he said there was no need for people to change their daily routines âat this moment.â but he warned that could change if âyou start to see community spread.â fauci said the virus could develop into a âmajor outbreakâ or âit could be something thatâs reasonably well controlled.â
on march 9, just two days before perdueâs comments, fauci was still talking about the coronavirus as âan evolving thingâ and that holding campaign rallies âin a place where there is no community spread, i think the judgment to have it might be a good judgment.â
things changed quickly though in the days after perdue made those comments on march 11. the day of that interview, the world health organization declared the global outbreak a pandemic, and two days later, trump announced a national emergency.


the ad then highlights a comment perdue made at a chamber of commerce meeting on may 14: âweâve had ordinary flu seasons with more deaths.â perdue rightly noted that there were about 80,000 deaths from covid-19 at that time, and there were an estimated 61,000 influenza deaths in the 2017-2018 flu season (though the average over the last decade has been fewer than 40,000 per year). but even at the time it was a flawed comparison and, of course, covid-19-related deaths continued to mount through the summer and fall (and now stand at more than 247,000). we have repeatedly fact-checked the president for making faulty comparisons between the flu and covid-19, which has proven to be much more deadly (as medical experts repeatedly warned).
the ad then uses a quote from perdue at a different chamber of commerce meeting on april 28: âthe numbers projected were supposed to be much worse.â perdue credited trumpâs actions for keeping those numbers down.
as we have written numerousâ timesâ in the past when trump claimed to have averted some 2 million deaths, a forecast of 2.2 million deaths in the u.s. is based on a model from imperial college london in march that predicted u.s. deaths if no mitigation measures were taken and no individual behavior changes occurred. the figure, therefore, was not intended to be an estimate of likely deaths.
and as we have written, research does support the idea that lockdowns â which were instituted by states, not trump â saved lives earlier this year, although itâs hard to say how many.â 
finally, the ad uses a clip from perdue being interviewed on cnbc on june 16 in which he was asked about the reopening plan in georgia. âitâs going very well,â perdue said.
fauci and other medical experts were critical in may of georgia and some other republican-led states for opening too early. at the time, perdue told politico that he had recently eaten in restaurants twice in georgia and, âweâve got to get this economy open again. weâre on the back side of the cycle.â however, new cases spiked in georgia in july and august.
readers can make what they will of perdueâs comments and decide for themselves if he downplayed the virus.
the perdue campaign points to other comments and statements perdue made around the same time that suggest he took the pandemic seriously and took measures to help protect the public.
for example, on march 2 after the first two cases of the coronavirus were reported in georgia, perdue and loeffler issued a press release stating, in part, âweâre closely monitoring the cases of coronavirus in georgia and urge everyone to take extra precautions. governor kemp and the trump administration are working with us to ensure we keep georgians healthy and safe. it is of utmost importance that georgia has the resources necessary to respond accordingly.â
and on march 23, perdue released a public service announcement via video, which began: âfirst of all, i know this virus is causing a lot of concern, and rightfully so. let me assure you of this: the worldâs best public health officials are right here in georgia at the cdc. theyâre working around the clock to help contain this virus and to develop a vaccine.â



perdue, march 23: the presidentâs early travel restrictions gave us time to prepare for the virus, and weâre continuing to take action to safeguard public health. weâre doing this by cutting red tape, partnering with the private sector to expand testing availability, and ensuring state and local officials have the resources they need. weâre also working on ways to help families and businesses that might be impacted financially.
finally, please remember to follow the advice of public health officials: stay home if you are sick; wash your hands frequently with soap and water; keep a safe distance from others. if you are experiencing symptoms, call your health care provider right away. you donât necessarily need to go there, just call them and give them your symptoms.

the perdue campaign also pointed to a number of covid-19-related actions perdue has taken, including helping small businesses access the paycheck protection program and helping to locate personal protective equipment for front-line workers.
the perdue campaign also touted measures in the cares act, a nearly $2 trillion stimulus package to bolster the economy in response to the coronavirus pandemic. it included direct payments to americans, loans for small businesses, support for hospitals and more. the bill passed unanimously in the senate. perdue, of course, voted for it, although he opposed two of its major provisions: the direct payment of $1,200 checks to qualifying individuals and the $600-per-week in additional unemployment payments.
one one front, perdue has been out ahead of, and clearer than, the president: encouraging the public to wear masks.
trump has waffled on his support for mask-wearing from the start â saying on april 3, the day the cdc issued recommendations for public mask-wearing, that he would not personally be wearing a mask. in an interview in early may, perdue said that in senate meetings the week before, âwe all wore masks. we actually had a meeting before then (and) we had masks. and we have hand sanitizers, signs everywhere about washing hands and maintaining social distance. i think itâs very important that america sees that, that we are functioning, and that this is an essential part of life, that we work together.â
in an interview on fox news on june 30, perdue said, âi absolutely support wearing masks. we wear them here in the senate. weâve been back here for five weeks. we follow the protocols that the military and our essential workers have been following. we wash our hands, we use masks, and if we follow that, i believe the infection rate can be managed.â
and on july 9, perdue tweeted a picture of himself wearing a mask and imploring the public to âwear a mask, wash your hands, practice social distancing.â
that was 11 days before trump did the same thing.
in ossoffâs ad, a chart shows the rising covid-19 death count, while trump and perdue comment about the virus. but the chart is misleading. for example, when perdue said âthe risk of this virus â¦ still remains low,â the chart shows the number of deaths increasing from about 15,000 to 83,000. but, as we said, that comment was made when there were about 1,500 cases and about 37 deaths nationwide (and just 17 cases and no deaths in georgia). similarly, the graphic shows the death count rising from about 180,000 to about 210,000 when perdue said âthe numbers projected were supposed to be much worseâ â when, in fact, there were 54,761 deaths at the time of his remarks on april 28.
that puts perdueâs comments in a worse light. still, perdueâs comments comparing covid-19 to the flu, praising georgiaâs early reopening plan and crediting trump for keeping the death count below projections are all flawed. but again, weâll let readers determine for themselves if those comments prove perdue âignored the medical expertsâ and âdownplayed the crisis.â

115,"in this video, we take a look at covid-19 antibody tests, which can reveal whether someone was previously infected with the novel coronavirus â and explain why a positive or negative result may not always be so easy to interpret.

antibodies are y-shaped proteins the body generates as part of an immune response to a specific pathogen. because the proteins are highly specific, tests that can check for the presence of antibodies in a personâs blood have the potential to identify people who have already encountered the virus.
such information is critical to figuring out how widely the novel coronavirus, or sars-cov-2, has spread, and could also be used to identify people who are immune.
but the tests are only beginning to be rolled out, and many are not accurate enough to use.
further complicating any use of the tests in the clinic is that scientists donât know whether antibodies can protect someone from becoming infected again with covid-19. while experts strongly suspect that will be the case, itâs not known for certain yet, nor it is clear how long any potential immunity would last.

260,"last month, the biden administration announced a plan to begin administering third shots of the two mrna covid-19 vaccines to healthy people in mid-september to shore up potentially flagging immunity to the coronavirus.â 
but many scientists say that given the available evidence, which shows the two-dose vaccines still provide formidable protection against severe disease, itâs not yet clear that boosters are needed.
âwhat we expected from this vaccine is that we wanted it to protect against severe disease and the kind of disease that caused you to go to the hospital or icu. that was the goal â keep people out of the hospital and keep them out of the morgue,â dr.â paul a. offit, a vaccine expert at the childrenâs hospital of philadelphia, told us. âthereâs no evidence that thereâs any fading of immunity in that regard.â
in fact, on sept. 3,â acting fda commissioner dr. janet woodcock and cdc director dr. rochelle walensky, a few weeks after backing the plan,â told the white house that the fda and cdc might only be able to make a determination on the pfizer/biontech vaccine for a subset of non-immunocompromised people in the next several weeks. thatâs because of a lack of data on both vaccines in the larger population.
moreover, some experts say booster shots are unlikely to alter the trajectory of the pandemic much â and that the doses would be much better spent getting people around the world immunized with first and second shots.â 
âiâm truly disappointed. this decision is not justifiable at all looking at this data,ââ tweetedâ dr.â muge cevik, a physician and infectious disease expert at the university of st. andrews in scotland, who also serves as a covid-19 advisor to the scottish and u.k. governments. âwe are going to use up millions of doses to reduce the small risk of mild infections in fully protected [people with] a tiny risk of hospitalisation, while most of the world waits for a first dose.â
the controversial announcement, made in an aug. 18â press briefingâ by multiple top public health officials, proposed offering a third âboosterâ shot to americans eight months after their second dose of a pfizer/biontech or moderna vaccine. according to the plan, this would mean those initially prioritized for the first two doses â primarily older people and health care workers â would also get first dibs on a booster.
the nationâs health agencies had already signed off on providing a third dose of the mrna vaccines to immunocompromised people. the food and drug administration authorized additional doses in that population for emergency use on aug. 12, and the centers for disease control and preventionâs advisory committee on immunization practicesâ and theâ agencyâ endorsed that view the following day.â 
those doses, which are meant to try to bump up a lackluster immune response to normal levels, are not controversial â and they arenât typically referred to as boosters, which is a term sometimes reserved for an extra dose that is used to restore immunity after the primary series is complete. some scientists haveâ arguedâ that in healthy people, third doses for covid-19 should also not be called boosters if a three-dose course is the standard regimen.â 
the mrna covid-19 vaccines could very well turn out to be three-dose shots, as multiple other immunizations involve three doses. but because that is not yet fully established â and the vaccine companies and federal agencies are also using the term â we will refer to third doses for healthy people as boosters for now.
while health officialsâ repeatedly saidâ that the decision to boost in healthy people would only occur pending review by fda and acip, a specific date â sept. 20 â was nevertheless set for the rollout to begin.
aâ statement, signed by all the leading public health officials, includingâ acting fda commissioner dr. janet woodcock and cdc director dr. rochelle walensky, was released the same day explaining the plan, which did not yet include a second dose for the johnson & johnson vaccine.
âthe available data make very clear that protection against sars-cov-2 infection begins to decrease over time following the initial doses of vaccination, and in association with the dominance of the delta variant, we are starting to see evidence of reduced protection against mild and moderate disease,â the statement reads, referring to the coronavirus. âbased on our latest assessment, the current protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death could diminish in the months ahead, especially among those who are at higher risk or were vaccinated during the earlier phases of the vaccination rollout. for that reason, we conclude that a booster shot will be needed to maximize vaccine-induced protection and prolong its durability.â
offit is critical of how the announcement circumvented the standard procedures. âit was just declared to be something that we were going to be doing,â he said. âit didnât go through the fda advisory committees, it didnât go through the cdc advisory committees.â
and, he said, it was badly communicated. âitâs confusing to people. people think theyâre no longer protected and they are protected,â he said. âi consider myself to be protected against severe disease, based on all the data.â
other experts said the messaging could be problematic, especially for people already harboring mistrust of the vaccines.â âfor those who think [the vaccine is] either ineffective, experimental, or doesnât work, the idea that there would already need to be a booster â that theyâre kind of changing information around the vaccine â could certainly lead to an increased reticence to not get it,â rachael piltch-loeb, a public health emergency researcher at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health, told us.
two high-level fda employees overseeing vaccine regulation decided to leave the agency later this fall,â reportedlyâ in partâ becauseâ of disagreement over the booster shot decision and the way it was handled.
before the sept. 3 news that the fda and cdc may only recommend boosters in more limited circumstances, it had already been unclear how the administration would be able to stick to its sept. 20 deadline. a pfizer representative said in an aug. 30 regulatory meeting that the company would have efficacy data on its booster shot by late september or early october. pfizer began submitting data to the fda on aug. 16 and started its supplemental approval application on aug. 25; moderna began submitting data on its half-dose booster to the agency on sept. 1. the fdaâs independent advisory committee is slated to review pfizerâs booster application on sept. 17.
update, sept. 24: the cdcâ issued booster shot recommendationsâ on sept. 24, saying that people age 65 and older, residents in long-term care facilities, and people age 50 to 64 with underlying medical conditions should get a booster shot of the pfizer/biontech vaccine at least six months after they completed the primary two-shot series. the agency said that two other groups â those age 18 to 49 with underlying medical conditions or 18 to 64 with increased risk of exposure to covid-19 because of their jobs or institutional setting â âmayâ get a booster shot in the same time frame âbased on their individual benefits and risks.ââ 
on sept. 22, the fdaâ had amendedâ the emergency use authorization for the pfizer vaccine to allow for booster shots for those groups.â 
in addition to real-world efficacy data, the fda reviewed data from pfizer/biontech on a subset of those participating in the original clinical trial. pfizer/biontech also found that the incidence of covid-19 among those who were fully vaccinated early in the clinical trial was higher in july and august, compared with trial participants who got their doses later. âthe fda determined that the rate of breakthrough covid-19 reported during this time period translates to a modest decrease in the efficacy of the vaccine among those vaccinated earlier,â fda said.
theâ fdaâs vaccines and related biological products advisory committee had supported the amended eua for those groups. itâ voted againstâ recommending a booster shot of the pfizer/biontech vaccine for everyone 16 and older in its sept. 17 meeting.â the cdcâs advisory committee on immunization practicesâ votedâ on sept. 23 to recommend boosters for the first three groups in the cdcâs recommendations, but not for 18- to 64-year-olds at increased risk because of their jobs or institutional setting. the vote was 9-6 against that recommendation. in a statement, walensky, the cdc director,â said: âat cdc, we are tasked with analyzing complex, often imperfect data to make concrete recommendations that optimize health. in a pandemic, even with uncertainty, we must take actions that we anticipate will do the greatest good.ââ â â â â 

severalâ otherâ countriesâ eitherâ have plans to roll out booster shots to their populations or have begun them â most notably israel, which is experiencing a surge of the delta variant andâ firstâ promoted boosters for people 60 years of age and older, given at least five months after the second shot, beforeâ movingâ to individuals 12 and older on aug. 29. but much of the rest of the globe has yet to get a first inoculation.â 
âweâre planning to hand out extra life-jackets to people who already have life jackets while weâre leaving other people to drown without a single life jacket,â said dr.â mike ryan, the executive director of the world health organizationâs health emergencies programme, in a press briefingâ on aug. 18. âthatâs the reality.â
the agencyâ hasâ calledâ for a moratorium on boosters for people who are not immunocompromised, at least until the end of the month, to allow the most vulnerable people in all countries to be vaccinated.
here, weâll explain what the studies say so far and why some scientists are skeptical of the immediate need for boosters, given the strong performance of the vaccines thus far.
the case for boosters
inâ presentingâ their rationale for the decision on aug. 18, health officials pointed to multiple recent studies conducted in the u.s. that have suggested a decline in the real-world effectiveness of the pfizer/biontech or moderna vaccines in preventing any kind of lab-confirmed infection.
oneâ study, published in the cdcâs morbidity and mortality weekly report, identified a modest decline in vaccine effectiveness against any kind of lab-confirmed infection, whether symptomatic or not â from 92% in early may to 75% in late july â in adults living in new york state, the vast majority of whom had been immunized with mrna vaccines.â 
an unpublishedâ study of patients in the mayo clinic health system compared the two mrna vaccines and found the pfizer/biontech vaccine began with an effectiveness of 76% against any kind of pcr-confirmed infection in january that fell to 42% in july. the drop for moderna was smaller, from 86% to 76%.
anâ mmwr study of a more vulnerable population â u.s. nursing home residents â found that the effectiveness of the mrna vaccines against lab-confirmed infections fell from 75% in the pre-delta era to 53% with delta.
walensky also presented data that wasâ published in the mmwr the following week, which showed a decrease in vaccine effectiveness against pcr-confirmed infection in frontline workers, from 91% before the delta variant to 66% when delta predominated. those workers were screened weekly for covid-19 and also were tested if they had covid-19-like symptoms.
these declines, officials said, could be due to waning immunity over time, the delta variant or some combination of the two.
notably, however, officials said there was not much evidence that the vaccines were working less well in protecting against severe disease. the new york study, for example, found that vaccine protection against hospitalization remained at 90% or higher for each week analyzed. and another mmwr report, which drew on hospital information from 18 states, found the pfizer/biontech and moderna vaccines stayed 84% to 86% effective in preventing hospitalization for 24 weeks.
instead, the argument was that the reduced effectiveness against infection and milder forms of illness could be a harbinger of what might come â and that the government therefore wanted to plan for boosters to âstay aheadâ of the virus.â 
âeven though this new data affirms that vaccine protection remains high against the worst outcomes of covid, we are concerned that this pattern of decline we are seeing will continue in the months ahead, which could lead to reduced protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death,ââ explainedâ dr.â vivek murthy, the u.s. surgeon general.
dr.â anthony fauci, bidenâsâ chief medical adviser and director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, alsoâ outlinedâ the immunological basis for boosters, noting thatâ antibody levels decline following vaccination; that higher antibody levels are associated with higher vaccine efficacy, which could be needed against delta; and that thereâs evidence from both vaccine companies that booster shots can greatly increase antibody levels.
officials mentioned data coming out of israel to bolster their case, but did not cover it in any detail until aâ press briefingâ on sept. 2. israel has fully vaccinatedâ almost 63%â of its population, as of sept. 1, and hasâ used the pfizer/biontech vaccine for nearly all of its citizens.
in the sept. 2 briefing, fauci noted the rising number of covid-19 cases among the vaccinated in israel and reviewed two unpublished papers, posted to preprint servers, documenting the effects of a booster dose in the country.â 
oneâ preprint, using ministry of health information on people over the age of 60 who either did or did not receive a third dose, found a more than 10-fold decrease in the risk of confirmed infection and severe disease in booster recipients compared with non-booster recipients, 12 or more days after boosting.â 
a secondâ preprint analyzed data from more than 150,000 people in an israeli health care system who were tested for sars-cov-2 infection in the first three weeks of august. it found that seven to 13 days after a booster shot, people were 46% to 68% less likely to test positive for the virus compared with those who had not received a booster; the risk reduction increased to 70% to 84% 14 to 20 days post-booster.
âthereâs no doubt from the dramatic data from the israeli study,â fauci said, âthat the boosts that are being now done there and contemplated here support, very strongly, the rationale for such an approach.â
recently, officials have also cited internal data along with that of other countries to support their decision, such as when walensky was askedâ in an aug. 31â press conferenceâ whether she was still confident that boosters would be available by sept. 20, given some reluctance on the issue from the cdcâs advisory committee the previous day.
âacip did not review international data that actually has led us to be even more concerned about increased risk of vaccine effectiveness waning against hospitalization, severe disease and death,â she said. âthey will be reviewing that as well, but it is our own data as well as international data that has led us to be concerned that the waning weâre seeing for infection will soon lead to a waning that we would see for hospitalizations, severe disease and death, which is why itâs so critical now, to plan ahead, to remain ahead of the virus.â
it is unclear what internal data walensky might have. we reached out to the agency for more details, including when that data would be made public, but did not receive a reply.
lack of an obvious need to boost immunity
while fauci may be convinced by the data, other scientists are not so sure. not only is it not yet known how helpful a booster will be long-term, they say, but itâs far from clear that they are needed in the first place.
while it depends on the goal of vaccination and is ultimately a judgment call, multiple experts told us that boosters wouldnât be warranted until the vaccines started to be less effective in preventing severe illness, which for healthy people, hasnât happened yet.
âthe best available data that we have are that these vaccines are still working really well against the current variants and this current wave,â johns hopkins epidemiologistâ david dowdyâ told us.
some people have pointed to israeli data that might suggest a decline in vaccine effectiveness against severe covid-19 in older people, but no published or preprint work convincingly demonstrates this yet, dr. aaron richterman, an infectious disease fellow at the hospital of the university of pennsylvania, told us.
some studies, he said â in particular a well-done unpublished study from oxford university that involved random testing of households for sars-cov-2 â have observed modest decreases in vaccine protection against infection (see figure 2). but in his view, infection alone would not warrant a booster rollout.
a visually compelling example of the vaccinesâ preserved effectiveness against hospitalization comes from the cdcâs covid-19-associated hospitalization surveillance network, or covid-net, which tracks covid-19 hospitalizations in 14 states.
idence
the immunology data also back the notion that in healthy people, the vaccines are holding steady against severe covid-19, if not always against infection or more mild illness.
âwe see antibodies going down, but we know that these vaccines make very good t cell responses and b cell responses that very likely protect from serious disease,â e. john wherry, an immunologist at the university of pennsylvania who has been studying the immune responses of vaccinated people, told us.
high levels of so-called neutralizing antibodies are needed to prevent infection entirely, or whatâs known as sterilizing immunity. but if those decline, which isâ normal, there are still immune cells around to ward off illness â namely, the b cells that make antibodies and the t cells that assist in that process and can also kill infected cells to limit the spread of a virus in a body.
both cell types need time to kick into gear when a person is first infected or first vaccinated, but with a second exposure, the cells can re-engage, proliferate and more quickly mount an immune response than before â preventing a person from falling very ill.
âsevere disease occurs when the virus begins to replicate unchecked in the lungs and the immune system misfires in efforts to control it,ââ deepta bhattacharya, an immunologist at the university of arizona college of medicine, told us. âfortunately, the lungs are much more accessible to antibodies than is the upper respiratory tract, which is where the virus first enters. moreover, because the virus hits the upper respiratory tract first, it buys memory b and t cells time to get going too before the lung becomes accessible to the virus. so for these reasons, protection against severe disease is expected to be maintained for far longer than protection against all infections.â
wherryâs lab andâ othersâ haveâ shownâ that these long-lived and memory b and t cell responses to mrna vaccination are durable, lastingâ at leastâ six months, and likely longer.
some unpublishedâ workâ from the wherry lab suggests that the pool of memory b cells that can recognize the virus continues toâ increaseâ over time after vaccination, unlike antibodies that wane.
all of this is why immunologists suspect boosters might not be needed for a while yet.
âwe could have protection against severe disease for a year, two years, three years,â said chopâs offit, who nevertheless said boosters were likely eventually. âweâll see.â
itâs also why offit doesnât buy the administrationâs argument that fading vaccine immunity against infection or mild disease necessarily presages dwindling effectiveness against severe disease. âi think itâs built on a false premise,â he said.â 
bhattacharya similarly said that he thought it would be âyearsâ before a booster is needed to increase protection against severe disease. but if the goal is to prevent infection, then it might take annual boosters to keep antibody levels high.
a benefit to boosting now?
the experts we spoke with agreed that giving third doses of the mrna vaccines now could very well be somewhat helpful, but likely only to a limited degree â and would not be as advantageous as immunizing unvaccinated people.
âboosting would almost certainly raise the concentration of antibodies for a while. how much clinical benefit we would see is much harder to predict,â bhattacharya told us in an email. âgiven that most estimates place the current 2-dose regimen at ~80+% effectiveness against symptomatic infections, there is not a ton of room to improve.â
âthe real question is whether booster shots enhance memory,â said dowdy. âif so, they could boost immunity for a longer period of time. but we have no evidence one way or the other on that. and also no compelling evidence that immunity from the initial vaccine series has waned to the extent that a booster is needed.â
while on the surface the israeli studies suggest boosters might have a large impact, those effects have so far been observed only for a short period of time, and it remains unknown how long they might last.
âit would be very surprising if a third dose of a vaccine that we already know is effective didnât decrease risk of infection by some amount over the short-term,â richterman said. but, he added, the extra dose âprobably doesnât decrease it to the degree that these observational studies from israel suggest because of large differences in exposure risk / behaviors between those getting the booster and those who did not.â
richterman was especially dubious of the booster preprint that claimed a 10-fold reduction in the risk for severe covid-19, which he said was âessentially uninterpretableâ because it had a design flaw known as immortal time bias. because outcomes werenât counted for the boosted group until 12 days after getting the booster, he said, that group likely had less follow-up than the unboosted group, biasing the results in favor of boosters. âit takes on average 5 days from diagnosis to develop severe infection, oftentimes much longer,â he said, âso you can imagine that the boosted group has probably in many cases not even had the chance to have this outcome.â
it should be more clear what effect boosters have once the results are in from pfizer/biontechâsâ phase 3 randomized controlled trial, he said.
dowdy also cautioned against relying too heavily on the israeli experience. noting that the population of the country is about the same as the state of michigan â and the u.s. would be unlikely to make national policy based on one state â he said, âwe should be similarly hesitant to formulate national policy on data from a country the size of israel.â
another potential boon of boosters is their impact on reducing transmission of the coronavirus. but many scientists are skeptical that boosters will do much to bring the pandemic to a close.
âi doubt this would have a dramatic impact on the trajectory of the pandemic,â bhattacharya said. âwe know that vaccinated breakthrough infections can transmit, but the major drivers of the pandemic are still transmission from and to the unvaccinated.â
âthe problem right now is not that we need to boost people who are already vaccinated. the problem is we need to vaccinate people who arenât vaccinated,â said offit. âthe vaccineâs working, but it doesnât work if we donât give it.â
relative to vaccinating new people, booster shots would be expected to be only incrementally helpful in reducing transmission and mitigating the pandemic, richterman said. âkeep in mind that 1% of the low-income world has been vaccinated. if we want to end the pandemic, that is where the work must be done,â he added.
for its part, the biden administration says it can âdo bothâ â provide boosters to americans while also helping other countries get first and second jabs. officials have emphasized that the u.s. is the global leader in vaccine donations and announcedâ on sept. 2 that the government would be investing nearly $3 billion to scale up domestic vaccine manufacturing. critics, however, say more should be done.
beyond theâ ethicsâ of working toward vaccine equity, dowdy said a case could be made that even from a purely self-serving perspective, the u.s. should focus on helping to administer first and second doses, rather than rolling out booster shots to its own population, as that would limit circulation of the virus overall and help prevent the emergence of more transmissible or dangerous viral variants.
to boost or not to boost?
ultimately, the decision to boost is âone thatâs going to have to be made in the face of imperfect evidence,â said dowdy. the administration is in the difficult situation of trying to balance waiting for enough evidence against the risk of a surge in cases.
âi feel like the data right now to support any decisions are pretty weak,â he said. âbut thatâs also the nature of this. thereâs no way that weâre going to be able to make the decision with great data without seeing a spike in cases.â
several scientists said many questions remain about the best way to do a covid-19 booster,â including the number, spacing between doses and whether itâs advantageous toâ boost with a variant-specific vaccine orâ mix and match with different vaccines.

âi think thatâs going to require more complicated studies to sort out,â wherry said of the possibility of altering the timing of the doses or using mix-and-matched shots. âand i donât know that weâre going to get to the bottom of that in the current pandemic situation.â


as for what happens next with the administrationâs booster plan, weâll learn more in the coming weeks as the fda and cdc make recommendations and potentially release more research.
update, sept. 17: the cdc corrected and republished the new york study on sept. 17, and we have updated two of the statistics from the study accordingly.â 
we also removed a section of this story, which explored the studyâs original finding of no decline in vaccine effectiveness for people age 65 and older, but a decline in younger people and the population as a whole. the corrected study now shows a 10.5 percentage point decline in effectiveness, to 80%, for those age 65 and older. thatâs still notably lower than the decline of 20.2 percentage points for the 18-to-49 age group.â 
we also contacted johns hopkins epidemiologist david dowdy, who had been quoted in that section of our story. dowdy told us of the corrected study: âi would still say that the trend in vaccine effectiveness over time is very gradual, with the vaccines still having 75% or greater effectiveness at the end of the time period.â
our original story also said that another cdc study found vaccine effectiveness against infections among nursing home residents had dropped to 52% in the delta era. theâ correctâ figure is 53%.â "

383,"glenmark pharmaceuticals on saturday announced the launch of its antiviral drug favipiravir, to treat mild to moderate covid-19 cases in india.
amid this, social media was abuzz with various claims surrounding 'favipiravir'. 
below are some of the claims: 

 
the logical indian received multiple requests on its fact check number to authenticate the various claims. 
claim:
glenmark pharmaceuticals received approvals from drug controller general of india to manufacture and market favipiravir, an anti-viral drug, to treat covid-19 patients.fact check:the claim is true.backed by clinical evidence and after the evaluation of data and in consultation with the subject expert committee, the mumbai-based firm received the manufacturing and marketing approval from india's drug regulator on friday, june 19.the drug will be available as a prescription-based medication for rs 103/tablet, with recommended doses being 1800 mg twice daily on day 1, followed by 800 mg twice daily up to day 14.
favipiravirdiscovered by toyama chemical co., ltd. in japan, favipiravir was initially approved for therapeutic use in resistant cases of influenza. in 2014, favipiravir was approved in japan to treat cases of influenza that were unresponsive to conventional treatment. owing to its efficiency at targetting several strains of influenza, it has been investigated in other countries to treat novel viruses including ebola and most recently, covid-19.it is currently being tested in 18 clinical trials for covid-19 and results from two studies have shown a positive outcome, while data from other trials are awaited.the list of the ongoing clinical trials with this drug can be accessed here.below is the press release by glenmark pharmaceuticals:
mode of action of favipiravir the genetic material of a virus is either dna-based or rna-based. favipiravir works exclusively on rna viruses.favipiravir works by preventing the virus from making copies of itself once it gets inside a host cell. this is done by targetting a key protein enzyme that the virus uses to multiply its genetic material (rna) inside the body, called rna polymerase. according to a study conducted on 80 subjects, favipiravir, compared to lopinavir/ritonavir, showed quicker clearance of the virus. the results showed that 91 per cent of the participants had better ct scans after treatment. however, it must be mentioned that the study wasn't randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled which is a trial format required to make a stronger argument for the drug's effectiveness.according to glenmark, favipiravir shows clinical improvements of up to 88 per cent in covid-19, with a rapid reduction in viral load by four days. what studies have been cited by glenmark?glenmark cited four studies in its press release, two from china and one reach from russia and japan. one of the studies conducted on 80 patients in china studied the efficacy of favipiravir as opposed to anti-retroviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir. favipiravir treatment led to a quicker reduction in viral load compared to the other drugs. in the second chinese study, 236 patients were enrolled.compared to umifenovir, another antiviral drug, favipiravir showed a better rate of clinical recovery on the seventh day. it also led to a quicker relief from fever and cough. the observational study in japan conducted with 2,141 patients with mild to moderate symptoms showed clinical improvement using favipiravir.if you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or whatsapp at 6364000343 also read: fact check: did tanzania find herbal cure for covid-19? contributors suggest correctioneditor : bharat nayak, creatives : abhishek mwrite feedbackglenmark pharmaceuticalsâ drug controller general of indiaâ favipiravirâ anti-viralâ covid-19 drugsâ facebooktwitterwhatsapptelegramlinkedinemailprintkoofacebooktwitterwhatsapptelegramlinkedinemailprintkoofacebooktwitterwhatsapptelegramlinkedinemailprintkoo"

778,"recent media reports in the united kingdom have noted the emergence of a âthai variantâ of sars-cov-2, the coronavirus that causes covid-19.
 those reports were based on a may 27 report by public health england (phe), an executive agency sponsored by the u.k. department of health and social care.
 the phe report notes that c.36.3 â the sars-cov-2 mutation at issue â was designated a variant under investigation on may 24 âon the basis of the mutation profile and increased importation from a widening international area.â

 approximately 109 cases had been detected in the u.k. at the time of the reportâs publication.
 trouble is, the variant didnât originate in thailand, as some news reports suggested. thatâs why the thai prime ministerâs p.r. office took to twitter.
 âthe director-general of the department of medical sciences clarified that there has been some misleading information in the media on the thai #covid19 variant found in the uk,â it tweeted.

 that statement is true.
 the director of thailandâs disease control department, dr. opart karnkawinpong, explained the first known host of the c.36.3 variant was an egyptian man who had traveled to hong kong and then bangkok on january 25, according to thai pbs, a public broadcasting service in thailand.
 after testing positive for covid-19, the man was hospitalized on january 29. karnkawinpong said that no one in thailand was reported to have been infected with the c.36.3 variant, and it should therefore be viewed as âimported.â
 that view is consistent with the british phe report, which noted that the c.36.3 variant was âfirst detected in sequence from thailand ex egypt.â

 whatâs it all mean? media reports labeling the variant solely as âthaiâ were misleading. and the confusion underscores the dangers of labeling virus variants by geography, something the world health organization and experts want to correct.
 it should be noted that some british media reports did state that the variant âwas first detected in thailand in people who had travelled from egypt,â as reported by yahoo news uk, the mirror, the independent and others. yet, some, like the independent, went for a clickbait headline, labeling the newly detected mutation a âthai variant.â
 the independent further used misleading language, saying the ""new mutant strain â¦ first emerged in thailand."" ""emerged"" implies place of origin, and that is unproved.

 researchers in the u.k. have developed a so-called pango network, which names versions of sars-cov-2 (such as b.1.1.7 and p.1).
 however, that naming system has not been universally adopted. thai media also have regularly referred to other variants of sars-cov-2 by their perceived geographical origins.

 katie baca, a historian of science and medicine at harvard university, and susana bejar, an internal medicine physician in new york city, have warned against ""naming pathogens or diseases as if they have nationalities.â
 for example, b.1.1.7, is commonly referred to as the âu.k. variantâ of sars-cov-2. the strain was reported as a âvariant of concernâ on december 14, 2020.
 but baca and bejar say that just because the u.k. first detected the b.1.1.7 variant, that âdoesnât mean the variant originated there.â they cite a bbc report that b.1.1.7 may have first been detected in the u.k. thanks to the countryâs robust genomic surveillance system.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 other sars-cov-2 strains widely referred to by their supposed place of origin include the b.1.617 strain, first detected in india, and the b.1.351 variant, first detected in south africa. a variant recently discovered in vietnam that is believed to be a hybrid of the b.1.1.7 and b.1.617 strains is not being referred to as the vietnam variant. 
 some thai public health officials say the naming conventions around another variant â p.1 â are analogous to those of c.36.3.
 p.1 was first detected in four travelers from brazil tested at haneda airport outside tokyo, japan, in january.

 the thai government has been blamed for a failed vaccine rollout and âbroken pandemic responseâ amid a recent surge in covid-19 infections. but the country is not alone in trying to avoid being cast as a virus originator.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 india's information technology (it) ministry has also asked social media firms to scrub all references to an âindian variantâ of sars-cov-2 from their platforms.
 âthis is completely false. there is no such variant of covid-19 scientifically cited as such by the world health organization (who). who has not associated the term 'indian variant' with the b.1.617 variant of the coronavirus in any of its reports,â reuters quoted the ministry as stating in a letter to social media firms.

 the claim is true.
 two days earlier, the serbian government announced new stricter nationwide curfew measures in response to the covid-19 coronavirus pandemic.
 among the new restrictions: walking back on pet walks.
 âguided by the expert opinion, the government of the republic of serbia has decided to withdraw the decision on the allowed walk of pets for 20 minutes between 20.00 and 21.00â (8 p.m. and 9 p.m.), the announcement read.
 it also extended the 3 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew on weekdays to include the weekends.
 initially, the serbian governmentâs covid-19 curfew allowed dog-walking for up to 200 meters outside the home and 20 minutes between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m.
 the dog-walking ban outraged serbian dog owners, the associated press reported.
 serbiaâs prominent animal rights groups and veterinarians published an open letter to the president and the government to back off.
 âthe decision threatens the dogsâ physical health, and the mental health of their respective owners, which are elevated in a situation of stress,â the letter stated.
 now, the only exceptions to the curfew apply to people in urgent need of medical assistance and farmers delivering groceries to urban stores.
 violating the curfew is a criminal offense punishable by a fine of up to 150,000 dinars ($1,406) and/or up to three years in prison.
 videos tracking dogs walking outside during the curfew hours can be seen posted by the serbian news channels.

 according to johns hopkins universityâs covid-19 dashboard, serbia has recorded 785 confirmed coronavirus cases and 16 deaths from the disease by march 30."
886,"people across the globe continue to seek answers on how to defeat the coronavirus that has sickened millions.
 one proposed solution has gained attention in recent weeks: vitamin d.
 a link between vitamin d and covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, caught the eye of u.s. rep. glenn grothman, r-glenbeulah. 
 in a may 21, 2020 news release, grothman encouraged the centers for disease control and prevention to look into vitamin dâs impact on the virus. 
 ""research illustrates a clear correlation between vitamin d deficiencies and (higher) covid-19 mortality rates,"" the release said.
 studies cited by grothman do suggest vitamin d deficiencies may have contributed to covid-19 deaths in some countries. but many questions remain about the relationship between the two, and researchers say more work should be done to better understand it.
 is grothman right about the correlation?
 vitamin d and covid-19 deaths
 grothmanâs news release cited studies out of northwestern university and trinity college in dublin that reached similar conclusions: countries with more deaths from the virus, such as spain and italy, also had higher rates of vitamin d deficiencies. 
 ""we saw a significant correlation with vitamin d deficiency,"" vadim backman, a northwestern professor who helped author one study, told the university website northwestern now.
 why look into vitamin d in the first place?
 aside from building healthy bones, vitamin d can boost the immune system by suppressing whatâs called a cytokine storm â severe inflammation that occurs when the immune system becomes overactive and releases too many cytokine proteins.
 backman said cytokine storms may contribute to covid-19 deaths because the storms can damage peopleâs lungs. an april 17, 2020 article on webmd also indicated that patients with severe covid-19 symptoms had high levels of cytokines in their system.
 the idea, then, is that vitamin d could suppress a catastrophic immune response and prevent people from developing severe covid-19 symptoms that lead to death.

 ""it will not prevent a patient from contracting the virus, but it may reduce complications and prevent death in those who are infected,"" backman said in the interview.
 letâs return to grothman.
 he did not say researchers found a connection, only a correlation between vitamin d levels and covid-19 deaths. thatâs on target. vitamin d is by no means a cure for the virus, and grothman conceded that we donât yet know the extent of the relationship.
 in an interview with politifact wisconsin, grothman reiterated his belief that federal agencies should further explore the issue. 
 ""i think a lot of times, the cdc and (national institutes of health) and that crowd primarily focus on new drugs,"" he said. ""if you have something right under your nose, letâs go with it.""
 what researchers say
 for now, researchers caution against reading too much into the available studies. 
 j. wesley pike, a biochemistry professor at the university of wisconsin-madison, said there is not enough proof yet to suggest a meaningful relationship between vitamin d and covid-19. researchers will need to conduct further studies to determine if that vitamin is effective in combating the coronavirus.
 ""thereâs simply no evidence that taking vitamin d will protect you,"" pike said. ""but again, we donât know. the answer is itâs possible."" 
 a group of researchers in europe and the united kingdom noted in a may 2020 paper that vitamin d supports the immune system and is recommended to help people maintain a healthy lifestyle. people can up their intake and avoid deficiencies through supplements, eating vitamin d-rich food and getting safe sunlight exposure.
 but vitamin d is not a ""magic bullet"" to prevent or treat covid-19, they wrote, and should not be taken in excessive doses that could present their own health risks.
 our ruling
 grothman claimed ""research illustrates a clear correlation between vitamin d deficiencies and (higher) covid-19 mortality rates.""
 early studies into vitamin d suggests it may curb the severity of covid-19 symptoms and reduce mortality rates. further research is needed to examine the issue, and vitamin d is not a cure for the coronavirus. 
 but grothman did not say it was a cure, only that there was a correlation. one expert noted the correlation was ""significant""

913,"the coronavirus has hit the african american and hispanic community particularly hard. in new york city, for example, the death rate for african americans is double the white death rate.
 in an interview on cnn, desiree rogers, ceo of the cosmetic firm black opal beauty and former social secretary in the obama administration, said the jobs black people do put them more at risk.
 ""we know that only 20% of african americans had jobs where they could work from home,"" rogers told cnn june 10. ""what does that tell you? they don't have the capacity to be able to work from home. they have service jobs, and so that means they have to be out.""
 social distancing under covid-19 thrust millions of workers into telework. rogersâ stat that only one in five african americans were able to exercise that option is accurate.
 the american time use survey has been asking households how they spend their time since 2003. broadly, people report what they have done in a 24-hour period.

 according to the latest survey data from the bureau of labor statistics, 19.7% of african americans could work at home. the fraction was even lower for hispanics â about 16%. the option to work at home was available to 30% of whites and 37% of asians. the figure for all workers is 28.8%.
 
 economists at the bureau of labor statistics said their survey doesnât show why the numbers play out the way they do, but they pointed to government data on race and ethnicity and type of job.
 black americans represent a bit over 12% of all workers, but are 26% of workers in health care support occupations, a field that includes hospitals and nursing homes. those are places of high risk for exposure to the coronavirus. 
 there are other reasons why the virus has a disproportionate impact on african americans, including underlying health conditions and less access to health care. 
 our ruling
 rogers said that only 20% of african americans have jobs where they could work from home. thatâs pretty much exactly what government data show.
 we rate this claim true."
935,"as new york state began implementing a regional approach to reopening after coronavirus-related shutdowns, a lawmaker from western new york complained that many of his constituents faced a longer wait to reopen because they were geographically linked to more hard-hit counties. 
 state sen. george borrello, who made the comments in a statement on may 11, represents new yorkâs 57th district, which includes three less-populated counties â allegany, cattaraugus and chautauqua â south of more heavily populated regions near buffalo (erie county) and niagara falls (niagara county).
 ""while infection rates in allegany, cattaraugus and chautauqua counties have consistently been among the lowest in the state throughout the covid-19 crisis, our linkage with erie county and its higher infection rates means that we donât meet the metrics for reopening, and our hurting, rural economies must remain shut down for at least another two weeks,"" borrello said in the statement.
 the stateâs reopening plan allowed regions to begin phase 1 of the reopening process on may 15 as long as they met seven metrics established by the state. the western new york region subsequently met all seven metrics on may 18 and entered phase 1 the following day.
 but we wondered whether borrello was correct in his may 11 statement that the infection rates in the three rural counties was substantially lower than those of the more urbanized counties to the north, and consistently among the state's lowest.
 we used the county-by-county infection tallies posted on gov. andrew cuomoâs pressroom page and converted them to a rate per 10,000 residents. we ranked the counties from the highest to the lowest for each week from march 30 to mid-may, when borrello made his statement.
 we found that, as borrello had said, allegany, cattaraugus and chautauqua counties ranked low in infection rates consistently over that period, while erie and niagara started higher and continued to rise:
 
 our analysis found that chautauqua never ranked higher than sixth from the bottom for infection rates among the 58 new york counties for which data was available, and chautauqua had the lowest rate of any county for much of the period.

 allegany and cattaraugus ranked marginally higher than chautauqua, but well below erie and niagara. 
 overall, the three small counties usually ranked in the bottom one-third of counties in the state, and by the time borrello made his statement, they were all in the bottom one-fifth of counties. by contrast, erie and niagara were consistently in the top half of counties as measured by infections per capita.
 new york city (including all five boroughs) ranked at or near the top for the entire period.
 the state reopening plan mirrored what many other states are doing, with certain types of non-essential businesses opening in phases in each of 10 regions, as long as certain health measurements are met in the region.
 borrello said in an interview that he just wants sensible reopening policies that are implemented ""fairly and equitably.""
 ""even though the infection rates are higher in erie county than the rest of the region, weâre still talking about keeping those same precautions and ensuring that theyâre being adhered to,"" he said.
 our ruling
 borrello said that ""infection rates in allegany, cattaraugus and chautauqua counties have consistently been among the lowest in the state.""
 a look at the data from the end of march to mid-may confirms that the infection rate in each of the three counties was usually in the bottom one-third of counties in the state, and by the time borello made his statement, they were all in the bottom one-fifth of counties. by contrast, erie and niagara were consistently in the top half of counties as measured by infections per capita.

957,"like many states, north carolina is tracking a record number of covid-19 cases this holiday season.
 and in an attempt to explain the severity of the illness, the stateâs top health official compared coronavirus deaths to data on the flu.
 ""sadly more than 5,000 north carolinians have lost their lives from this virus since our first death on march 12 of this year,"" health secretary mandy cohen said during a dec. 1 press conference.
 ""to give some perspective, just under 1,500 people died from the flu in the past 10 years,"" cohen said. ""in just 11 months, covid has killed more than three times that number.""
 is it true that the coronavirus has killed more north carolinians in a year than the flu has in 10 years?

 nc covid-19 deaths
 north carolinaâs department of health and human services tracks both covid-19 and influenza deaths.
 as of wednesday morning, the state had counted 5,284 covid-19 deaths. dhhs says those deaths include people who have had a positive molecular or antigen test for covid-19, who died without fully recovering from covid-19, and who had no alternative cause of death identified. 
 the deaths are reported by hospitals and clinicians directly to the local and state health departments.
 the first reported covid-19 death did, indeed, occur on march 12. 
 nc flu deaths
 the stateâs health department also tracks flu deaths and reports each flu seasonâs data on its website. flu deaths are reported by health providers and were confirmed as influenza by an appropriate laboratory or rapid diagnostic test.
 politifact reviewed the last 10 flu seasons, dating back to the 2010-2011 season. in total, we counted 1,486 reported flu deaths. dhhs spokeswoman kelly haight confirmed to us by phone that our total is accurate.
 hereâs a list of the flu death counts by season, and a link to the report for each respective season:

 other flu counts
 the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention also tracks flu deaths by state. at a glance, it might seem like the cdc and north carolina reports contradict one other. for instance, the cdc reported north carolina had 2,064 flu deaths in 2018, while the stateâs health department reported far less.
 thatâs because the cdc sometimes combines flu and pneumonia deaths together, officials said.
 under the ""flu & pneumonia"" section on the cdcâs flu deaths by state website, ""most of those deaths are pneumonia deaths,"" said jeff lancashire, acting associate director for communications for the cdcâs national center for health statistics.
 some pneumonia deaths are caused by the flu, but some can be caused by ""many other viruses, bacteria, bacteria-like organisms and fungi,"" said kelly haight, dhhs spokeswoman.
 the year 2018 is the most recent year of flu deaths available on the cdc site. 
 if you start in 2018 and look back 10 years to 1999, lancashire said ""there were 1,806 deaths from exclusively flu alone â without pneumonia (from the public database cdc wonder â wonder.cdc.gov)."" 
 ""so if dr. cohen was citing deaths from flu alone, she would be correct that covid19 deaths have exceeded that (number) in nc,"" he said. 
 the cdc has noted, however, that tallying death counts for covid-19, flu and pneumonia is complicated and sometimes its data can be incomplete.
 our ruling
 cohen said covid-19 has killed more north carolinians in a year than the flu has in the last 10 years.
 by the north carolina health departmentâs count, there have been 5,200 covid-19 deaths this year and 1,486 flu deaths over the last decade.
 cohenâs claim also tracks with data collected by the cdc, according to an agency spokesman. however, the cdc points out that exact numbers can be tricky to count because there are sometimes delays in processing death information.

958,"as state leaders in texas look to ease restrictions implemented to slow the spread of coronavirus in the state, some people have raised concerns about the number of tests the state has administered.
 u.s. rep. veronica escobar, d-el paso, raised the issue during a webcast with the wilson centerâs mexico institute and the migration policy institute on wednesday.
 ""texas, i believe, either is near the bottom or at the very bottom when it comes to testing per capita, so the numbers are probably far greater than what is being reported,"" she said. ""i believe we donât have an adequate idea of just how many cases and how many deaths are being reported.""
 at the time of escobarâs remark, texas had administered 216,783 tests for the coronavirus, with 21,069 positive results, according to the texas department of state health services. the state was reporting 542 coronavirus fatalities with an estimated 7,341 recoveries.
 escobarâs spokeswoman elizabeth lopez-sandoval pointed to the covid tracking project as the source of escobarâs claim comparing texas testing to other states.
 the covid tracking project was launched by the atlantic and tracks and publishes data from each state about testing, deaths and hospitalizations related to the coronavirus. 
 looking at the numbers
 with a population of more than 27.8 million in 2018 and 216,783 tests administered, texas had administered about 777 coronavirus tests per 100,000 people as of wednesday, ranking 48th among states in testing per capita.
 hereâs a look at the five states that had administered the fewest coronavirus tests per capita, as of wednesday:
 
 kansas: 20,203 tests, or about 695 per 100,000 residents
 virginia: 60,778 tests, or about 722 per 100,000 residents
 texas: 216,783 tests, or about 777 per 100,000 residents
 kentucky: 36,075 tests, or about 812 per 100,000 residents
 arizona: 56,601 tests, or about 842 per 100,000 residents
 
 the total number of tests administered in texas is significantly higher than other states at the lower end of the list, but testing per capita remains low.

 efforts to increase testing
 public health experts say a dramatic increase in testing is needed to ensure itâs safe to reopen sectors of the economy, as limited testing data means there are significant unknowns when it comes to the scope of the virus spread.
 the data that does exist is incomplete, as some private laboratories have not reported the number of negative tests they have administered. and there are clear discrepancies in some county-level data.
 for example, one small west texas county reported 12 positive cases of the virus but only reported administering one test as of april 13, according to the american-statesman. 
 during a news conference on april 17, gov. greg abbott said he spoke with the white house and was told texas would receive ""a dramatic increase"" in testing â ""not just testing those who may show symptoms, but also being able to test entire communities so that we have better information.""
 california and arizona have both expanded which individuals meet the criteria required for testing, allowing individuals with no symptoms to be screened.
 abbott told reporters that this increase in testing capacity is expected by ""late april or early may.""
 he declined to offer specifics, but said new testing will be coming from the private sector.
 texas department of state health services commissioner john hellerstedt said the private sector will play a role, but public health authorities also are working to grow their capacity.
 our ruling
 escobar said that texas ""is near the bottom or at the very bottom of covid-19 testing per capita.""
 data supports escobarâs statement and shows that texas has lagged behind other states in terms of coronavirus testing per capita. we rate this claim true."
968,"while explaining why his family would not be together celebrating thanksgiving this year, democratic gov. j.b. pritzker blasted online accusations that his daughter broke covid-19 protocols at a restaurant gathering.
 ""a parody twitter account posted a picture of a group of individuals eating outside a chicago restaurant, supposedly breaking the covid rules the city put in place,"" pritzker said at a nov. 17 press conference. ""and the person posting the photo claimed one of the people in it was my daughter.""
 ""my office put out a statement making clear this wasnât my daughter,"" pritzker said. ""but that didnât stop republican elected officials, a network of propaganda publications in the state and some radio shock jocks from telling people that the picture was of my daughter, despite knowing that this was a lie.""
 pritzker said his teenage daughter, teddi, was in florida with his wife, and would ""remain there indefinitely"" because she had started receiving ""hateful and threatening messages.""
 teddi is not identifiable among the group of 14 diners in the published photo. so we decided to find out where the misinformation came from and who had shared it. what we learned shows the governor was correct about how the rumors spread.
 the photo was originally shared on twitter by an account called @deuxmoiworld, according to a thread written by pritzkerâs chief of staff, anne caprara. that account links to a website that describes it as a purveyor of ""rumors and conjecture."" by the time we checked it, the image was deleted and the accountâs operator had apologized for sharing it.
 but the image was already being spread on other twitter accounts, caprara documented in her thread, including one that described itself as ""a parody account.""
 then a website with connections to conservative political operatives called chicago city wire picked it up, publishing a post based solely on the parody accountâs tweet. that accountâs tweets are now private. the story does not say which person in the photo is purportedly pritzkerâs daughter nor what date the photo was taken, though servers in the background are wearing masks.
 chicago city wire is produced by local government information services, a company run by conservative radio talk show host dan proft, state records show.
 in october, proft was featured in a new york times investigation into a nationwide string of local sites that purport to be news sites, but are instead vehicles for stories ordered up by gop groups and corporate pr firms. in 2015, proft teamed up with another controversial internet entrepreneur, brian timpone, to start a chain of such publications in illinois.
 proft and timpone did not respond to requests for comment.
 following complaints to the illinois board of elections about political funding behind the illinois sites, the times reported, a disclaimer on their ""about"" pages now says they are funded, ""in part, by advocacy groups who share our beliefs in limited government."" that disclaimer now appears on chicago city wire.
 we confirmed with pritzkerâs office these were the websites he was referring to as ""propaganda publications.""

 propaganda includes ""ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause,"" according to merriam-webster. while thereâs room for disagreement about the perimeters of the term, pritzkerâs use of it to describe these sites is reasonable in light of the new york timesâ findings.
 pritzkerâs spokeswoman also pointed to proftâs radio show, chicagoâs morning answer to explain his reference to ""radio shock jocks"" sharing the story.
 on the nov. 13 episode of the show, a listener called in to ask co-host amy jacobson and a guest host if they would confront the governor about city wireâs story.
 jacobson dismissed that suggestion, but still gave credence to the claim that teddi was pictured, saying, ""iâm glad that sheâs out socializing outside, iâm glad that sheâs living and not existing.""
 when reached by phone, jacobson declined to comment for this fact-check.
 several state republican lawmakers also chose to share the post, backing up the most serious portion of pritzkerâs claim.
 ""like iâve been saying from the beginning, this is how you handle a lockdown!"" rep. darren bailey of xenia wrote in a facebook post sharing the city wire story. baileyâs post has since been shared by more than 700 of his followers.
 rep. grant wehrli of naperville also retweeted a post from a twitter user who shared the story. that user has since apologized for spreading false information and deleted her original tweet.
 neither bailey nor wehrli responded to email inquiries or calls to their district offices asking why they believed the post was credible.
 our ruling
 pritzker said ""republican elected officials, a network of propaganda publications in the state and some radio shock jocks"" were spreading ""a lie"" about his daughter dining outside at a restaurant with a large group of people during the covid-19 pandemic.
 the false claim pritzker is referring to is based on a photograph of 14 individuals gathered around a table, none of which are identifiable as his daughter. it was spread by gossip and parody accounts on twitter before being picked up by a website operated by a company that accepts money from partisan groups and is run by a conservative talk show radio host whose co-host later repeated the claim on-air. while definitions of ""propaganda"" may vary, pritzkerâs use of the term here is reasonable given the context. two gop state lawmakers also shared the post on social media.
 we rate pritzkerâs claim true.

993,"face masks have become a go-to accessory in americaâs grocery stores and remaining public areas, with some prominent retailers even requiring them for entry.
 but many shoppers have taken it on themselves to go a step further â donning gloves as well.
 this pseudo-surgical garb may feel safer, but is it?
 
 one business that doesnât think so posted a sign outside banning gloves, and a picture posted may 5, 2020, that went viral on facebook. hereâs what it said in part:
 ""if you are wearing the same set of gloves all over town you are only spreading germs everywhere you go. every door you touch, the cart, the supplies, your phone, your car door, your face, money and change. â¦ donât wear the same gloves everywhere!""
 
 this post was flagged as part of facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (read more about our partnership with facebook.) 
 it seemed a good time to settle this question. does wearing gloves really hurt more than it helps?
 most likely, yes. hereâs what the experts have to say.
 cdc says no
 the glove guidance for the general public is simple from the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention: donât.
 ""cdc doesnât recommend the general public use gloves. gloves can be a source of contamination, even for the wearer, if not properly removed,"" spokeswoman kate grusich said in an email. ""covid-19 spreads through respiratory droplets that can land on surfaces. if the wearer touches a variety of surfaces during the day while wearing the same pair of gloves, contamination can definitely be transmitted from one surface to another.""
 the cdcâs online guide for glove use recommends wearing them when cleaning or caring for someone who is sick. it expressly notes gloves are a bad choice for running errands.
 ""the best way to protect yourself from germs when running errands and after going out is to regularly wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol,"" the website says.
 why gloves are a bad idea
 but we donât even have to take the cdcâs word for it. infectious disease experts across the country agree gloves are a bad idea for general use.

 people may assume gloves are a solution on their own without recognizing that in the medical field theyâre only part of the process. gloves are disposed of as soon as the medical personnel leave a contaminated area, and hands are washed before and after removing.
 ""weâre seeing a lot of people out in public wearing gloves, which isnât wrong so to say,"" said dr. patricia dandache, an infectious disease specialist at the cleveland clinic said this in a online post by the organization. ""but unfortunately, most people arenât wearing or disposing of their gloves correctly, which defeats the whole purpose.""
 and removing gloves is a tricky process. the cdc gives detailed guidance on it because even health care professionals struggle to do it in a way that avoids contamination.
 a 2019 study in the american journal of infection control found 37% of health care workers using their normal glove removal technique contaminated themselves in the process.
 even if gloves were removed correctly, theyâre problematic because people often wear them to multiple places.
 ""with or without gloves, if you touch one thing then touch something else, youâre potentially transmitting it (the virus) from one place to another,"" dr. david cutler, a family medicine physician at providence saint johnâs health center in santa monica, calif., told healthline.
 and the gloves arenât providing any additional protection from covid-19, said mary beth graham, medical director of infection prevention and control at froedtert hospital in milwaukee.
 ""for things like influenza, covid, etc., these are things where hand hygiene is sufficient,"" she said. ""the virus isnât going to go in through the pores of your skin on your hand. itâs going to get into you if youâre touching commonly touched surfaces and then going in to touch your nose, your mouth, your eyes â¦ before you do hand hygiene (washing).""
 all of which brings us to perhaps the largest danger of glove-wearing â the false sense of security.
 ""wearing gloves may make someone feel safe, but it will also make people very lax in regards to recognizing that the key part of even wearing gloves is hand hygiene,"" graham said. ""gloves are nothing without hand hygiene.""
 our ruling
 a viral facebook post warned against wearing gloves in public because keeping the same set on means ""you are only spreading germs everywhere you go.""
 infectious disease experts around the country agree gloves largely do more harm than good.
 they donât really protect the wearer since the coronavirus doesnât seep in through the skin. and they donât limit the disease spread since they are often worn too long or removed incorrectly.
 and perhaps most notably, wearing gloves can stop users from washing hands as often, which is the step that actually kills the coronavirus.
 we rate this claim true."
1095,"the latest state of emergency declared by gov. tony evers â his third since the start of the coronavirus pandemic â elicited the expected reaction from republicans.
 the latest order extended the stateâs mask mandate, which was set to expire sept. 30, for an additional two months.
 an avalanche of gop news releases and social media posts condemned evers, a democrat, calling the order ""illegal,"" ""unconstitutional,"" an ""overreach"" and a ""power grab."" assembly speaker robin vos, r-rochester, called it ""rule by fiat"" and said there would ""undoubtedly be additional court challenges"" â on top of the court challenges to previous orders.
 but one wisconsin democrat says vos has no reason to wait on court challenges.
 ""whenever you see a wi republican bemoan the governor's mask mandate, remember these 2 things,"" state sen. chris larson of milwaukee said sept. 23, 2020 on twitter. ""1) they have the power to overturn the order by joint resolution and they refuse to do it. 2) they sued to have control over our #covid19 response months ago, and have done nothing.""
 weâre focusing on the first point. itâs an overlooked element of the partisan showdown over wisconsinâs coronavirus response.
 and larson is exactly right. republicans could end eversâ order any time, if they got a majority vote in the chambers they control.
 letâs review what's going on.
 the state of emergency statute
 state law first gave the governor authority to declare a state of emergency in 1951, though that was related only to acts of war. the circumstances in which an emergency may be declared and the governorâs powers in that scenario have evolved since, including the addition of public health emergencies in 2002.
 the only prior public health emergency in state history came in 2009, when democratic gov. jim doyle issued executive order #280 in response to h1n1 (swine flu), according to the wisconsin legislative reference bureau.

 the section of statute evers relied on for his three orders isnât a long one, so hereâs the whole thing. weâve bolded the key element at the end:
 declaration by governor. the governor may issue an executive order declaring a state of emergency for the state or any portion of the state if he or she determines that an emergency resulting from a disaster or the imminent threat of a disaster exists. if the governor determines that a public health emergency exists, he or she may issue an executive order declaring a state of emergency related to public health for the state or any portion of the state and may designate the department of health services as the lead state agency to respond to that emergency. if the governor determines that the emergency is related to computer or telecommunication systems, he or she may designate the department of administration as the lead agency to respond to that emergency. a state of emergency shall not exceed 60 days, unless the state of emergency is extended by joint resolution of the legislature. a copy of the executive order shall be filed with the secretary of state. the executive order may be revoked at the discretion of either the governor by executive order or the legislature by joint resolution.
 so, revoking the order is a pretty straightforward process. and one way to do it is a joint resolution approved by both houses. whatâs more, unlike traditional legislation it is not subject to the governorâs veto â a simple majority is enough.
 the status of the legislature
 republicans hold a commanding majority in both houses. the advantage is 18-13 in the senate and 63-34 in the assembly (with two vacant seats in each chamber).
 senate majority leader scott fitzgerald said back in july that senate republicans had the votes and ""stand ready"" to overturn the first emergency declaration and mask mandate.
 that put the onus on vos, who said in his sept. 22, 2020, statement, ""no one branch of government can rule outside the letter of the law and go unchecked, even during a pandemic."" but vos has not taken action to be that check.
 itâs unclear whether assembly republicans are fractured on the issue, or if other political considerations are at play â such as not wanting to put members on record with a vote in the midst of a volatile election year. a vos spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.
 state sen. steve nass, r-whitewater, even issued a statement criticizing the inaction of vos and others in his party, saying vos ""has enabled the continuing illegal conduct of governor evers in issuing repeated emergency declarations and a failed statewide mask mandate."" 
 our ruling
 larson said in a tweet that the republicans who control the legislature ""have the power to overturn the order by joint resolution and they refuse to do it.""
 thatâs correct. republicans have the majority in both houses and the power under state statute. whatever the reason, they have not acted to end the governorâs state of emergency and accompanying mask mandate.
 we rate this claim true."
1125,"as physicians grapple with the best ways to treat patients infected with the coronavirus, one treatment that has gained increasing attention is convalescent plasma therapy.
 this therapy involves transfusing blood plasma from recovered coronavirus patients into a sick patient. the plasma contains a specific antibody that helps the immune system fight the virus. the idea is to help give seriously ill patients an immune-system boost so they can better fight off the virus.
 covid-19 convalescent plasma therapy is considered as an investigational product by the food and drug administration. 
 dr. jamie n. nadler, the medical director of quality and patient safety for buffalo general medical center and gates vascular institute in upstate new york, recently told the buffalo news that thereâs some evidence that it could be an effective way to treat covid-19. 
 ""there have been small trials and small attempts around the world that seem to have had some degree of success,"" nadler said. ""so it's worth trying as long as it's done correctly.""
 nadler is right: we found two studies of convalescent plasma therapy that have shown at least initial promise with covid-19 patients, although experts caution that more investigation is needed. (nadler did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)
 a brief history of convalescent plasma therapy
 convalescent plasma therapy has a long history. it was developed by paul ehrlich and emil von behring for treatment of diphtheria, a finding that was recognized in 1901 with the first nobel prize for medicine, epidemiologist dr. ian lipkin, a professor at columbia universityâs mailman school of public health, told cnbc. 
 more recently, it was used against severe acute respiratory syndrome, an infection with similarities to covid-19 that emerged in asia in the early 2000s. 
 in one study in hong kong during a sars outbreak, a hospital treated 80 patients with convalescent plasma. among the treated patients, the study showed a higher discharge rate prior to day 14 of the illness: 58.3% became well enough to be discharged, compared with 15.6% of those who did not receive the treatment.
 however, patients suffering from ebola â a different kind of virus in the filovirus family â did not experience positive results from convalescent plasma treatment.

 a study from china in the journal of the american medical association
 a chinese study, published in the journal of the american medical association, described a study treating five critically ill covid-19 patients with convalescent plasma. all five patients, ranging from 36 to 65 years old, began the study while on ventilators. 
 following the transfusion, the authors reported, four of the five patientsâ body temperatures normalized within three days. other key metrics, including viral loads, improved within 12 days.
 the hospital discharged three of the five patients. the remaining two were in stable condition 37 days after the transfusion. 
 the authors concluded that this represented an ""improvement,"" but cautioned that the limited sample size and study design precluded ""a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment.""
 a pre-publication study from china that has been posted online
 another chinese study found similar results. it has not yet been peer reviewed but has been published online. 
 in the study, 10 patients with severe cases received a dose of convalescent plasma. within three days, the viral load became undetectable in seven patients, with no adverse effects. in addition, fever, cough, shortness of breath and chest pain disappeared or significantly improved in all 10 patients within one to three days of the transfusion. 
 the authors concluded that the therapy was ""well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes"" in severe covid-19 cases. however, they added, questions on the optimal dose and timing need further investigation.
 ""just as covid-19 has taken us back to classic methods for outbreak containment like isolation, through a novel use we are rediscovering the lifesaving potential of a classic strategy like plasma therapy,"" lipkin said. 
 experts say that convalescent plasma therapy is promising, but much more work is needed.
 ""there have not been any breakthroughs recently,"" said jessica donington, a professor of surgery at the university of chicago and chief of the thoracic surgery section. but, she added, ""it all has been going on very quickly,"" with larger clinical trials in the works.
 our ruling
 nadler said that ""there have been small trials and small attempts around the world"" to test convalescent plasma therapy for coronavirus patients, and they ""seem to have had some degree of success.""
 we found two chinese studies that have found initial success, though more research is needed to confirm these results more broadly. we rate the statement true."
1192,"national shortages of masks, gowns and other personal protective equipment have exacerbated concerns that u.s. doctors and nurses are not getting the supplies needed to help covid-19 patients.
 the surging demand for masks led president donald trump to charge, without evidence, that the equipment earmarked for new yorkâs hospitals has been ""going out the back door."" but some people are pointing the blame back at trump, who downplayed the threat of the virus early on despite warnings from experts about the health care systemâs readiness. 
 one claim weâve heard from politicians, tv commentators and social media users is that the u.s. gave away medical supplies that are now sorely needed at home.
 ""on february 7, the (world health organization) warned about the limited stock of ppe,"" said a march 31 facebook post, using an acronym for personal protective equipment. ""that same day, the trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to china. now our health care workers are dying because of no ppe.""
 the post from blue dem warriors was flagged as part of facebookâs efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its news feed. (read more about our partnership with facebook.) in this case, the information is largely accurate.
 the state department announced on feb. 7 that it had ""facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.""
 the facebook post cited as its source of information a cnn editorial criticizing the shipment.
 the move came more than two weeks after the first u.s. coronavirus case was detected in washington state on jan. 21. secretary of state mike pompeo tweeted feb. 7 that the delivery would ""help save lives"" in china, which had reported more than 31,000 cases by then. 
 we have coordinated with u.s. organizations to transport more humanitarian relief to people in wuhan. personal protective equipment and other medical supplies donated by these organizations can help save lives in #china and help protect people from the #coronavirus. pic.twitter.com/57sn2txflpâ secretary pompeo (@secpompeo) february 7, 2020 
 pompeo touted the assistance again in remarks to reporters on march 31, saying it was an example of american generosity and part of an effort to keep the virus contained to china.
 the materials sent to china, pompeo said, were donated by samaritanâs purse, the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, and other private organizations. boeing and intermountain healthcare were also involved, according to a feb. 15 state department press release.
 on feb. 7, the state department also pledged to commit up to $100 million in existing funds to assist china and other countries. a state department spokesperson told us the $100 million promise has been fulfilled with funds from the u.s. agency for international development.

 the u.s. aid to date also includes about $110 million in humanitarian assistance for up to 64 different countries and roughly $64 million in refugee-related assistance for the united nations. 
 the spokesperson told us the security and health of americans comes first, but that ""the spread of covid-19 is a threat to our shared international security"" and that efforts aimed at responding to the virus abroad are also meant to help mitigate the spread in the u.s. 
 we wonât weigh in on whether the distribution of donated protective equipment to china was the right move. but the facebook post is correct that the u.s. announced the delivery in february. other fact-checkers said the same about a similar claim from rep. maxine waters, d-calif.
 the facebook post also notes that the timing of the china shipment coincided with a press conference in which the world health organization sounded the alarm about a ""limited stock"" of personal protective equipment. 
 thatâs accurate. who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus warned on feb. 7 of a potential supply shortage across the globe and especially in china. the warning was for the world, not the u.s. in particular.
 ""the world is facing severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment,"" ghebreyesus said. ""demand is up to 100 times higher than normal and prices are up to 20 times higher.""
 ghebreyesus said the situation was made worse by people outside of patient care using masks, for example. he said health workers and caretakers should be first to receive items from the limited stock, and that health workers in china needed ""the bulk of ppe supplies.""
 ""who discourages stockpiling of (personal protective equipment) in countries and areas where transmission is low,"" he said.
 the facebook post closes by saying ""our health care workers are dying because of no ppe."" 
 news reports indicate that some health workers â who are at an increased risk of exposure â are among the more than 200,000 infected americans and over 4,500 who have died. doctors and nurses have made shortages known and are tweeting the hashtag #getmeppe.
 some medical supplies are now coming into the u.s. from abroad. the white house arranged for the transport of tons of equipment from china, and the new england patriots recently lent its team plane to pick up 1.2 million n95 masks from china for massachusettsâ health workers.
 we asked the state department whether any of the donated materials sent to china in february made their way back to the u.s., and whether the donations would have gone straight to u.s. hospitals had they not been shipped overseas. we didnât get answers to those questions.
 our ruling
 a facebook post said: ""on february 7, the who warned about the limited stock of ppe. that same day, the trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to china.""
 the state department announced the delivery of nearly 18 tons of donated materials on feb. 7, the same day that the who sounded the alarm about the worldâs supply of personal protective equipment. the donated materials came from private groups.
 we rate this statement true."
1229,"endorsing his former vice president, joe biden, to win the white house, former president barack obama sought to contrast the 2020 platforms of democrats and republicans on a critical plank: their stance on the affordable care act. itâs a difference, he argued, that has assumed newfound urgency.
 ""the republicans occupying the white house and running the senate â¦ have shown themselves willing to cut millions off their health insurance and eliminate preexisting condition protections for millions more, even in the middle of this public health crisis,"" obama said.
 obama was referring to a couple of gop policies, the former presidentâs senior adviser eric schultz told khn. the first: a pending supreme court case, texas v. azar, in which the trump administration has argued the 2010 health law should be struck down. schultz also highlighted the white houseâs refusal to provide a special open enrollment period for the aca health exchanges in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.
 weâve previously checked claims about president donald trumpâs stance on the lawâs preexisting condition protections â arguably its most popular component â and his position on the texas v. azar lawsuit.
 but covid-19 adds new relevance, because of both the virusâs devastating health implications and bludgeoning impact on the american economy. indeed, the trump administrationâs handling of the virus crisis is shaping up to be a defining issue in the run-up to november. meanwhile, biden made the health care law a signature component of his presidential platform and has been a vocal critic of the administrationâs pandemic response.
 with that in mind, we decided to take another look.
 the republican agenda
 obama is correct: the republican party has opposed the aca for years. in 2016, then-candidate trump campaigned on its repeal. since then, the white house and congressional republicans have pursued an agenda that would dismantle the lawâs preexisting condition protections. republicans havenât united behind an alternative plan, either.
 first: the lawsuit. texas v. azar stems from the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act. that measure took the teeth out of the health lawâs individual mandate, which required that all americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. the tax law, pushed by republicans and signed by trump, set that penalty to $0.
 a collection of republican statesâ attorneys general now argue that, without the penalty, the rest of the health law doesnât work and should be struck down.
 killing the aca would eliminate the stipulation that insurance plans cannot charge people more if they have a preexisting condition, get rid of the subsidies it provides for people to buy insurance on the exchanges and gut the medicaid expansion that, in six years, directly extended coverage to more than 13 million people. the supreme court has agreed to hear the case, although it wonât rule until after the november election.
 the trump administration, while technically in the position that would defend the law in court, has declined to support it â a move legal experts say is almost unprecedented. in fact, the administration has even sided with the states arguing that it should be struck down. neither the white house nor senate republicans have put forth a replacement bill that would maintain the acaâs protections in the event the high court rules against the law.
 we asked the white house if the administration had changed its stance in the wake of the pandemic. trumpâs staff redirected us to the justice department, the federal governmentâs legal arm. the department did not respond to emailed requests for comment. as recently as the end of march, though, trump told reporters he still wanted the law ""terminated.""
 senate democrats have pushed the administration to change its position on the lawsuit. but republicans, who hold the senate majority, have been silent, a position that hasnât changed even since covid-19 effectively shut down large swaths of the country.
 in some ways, the republican stance isnât important, argued thomas miller, a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute, a public policy think tank. itâs hard to imagine the supreme court voting to get rid of the health law, especially in the midst of covid-19, he said.
 still, that doesnât change the facts of what trump is arguing.
 and the lawsuit is also only one part of the equation. another, is healthcare.gov.

 americans who have lost their jobs â and, often, the insurance that came with it â are eligible to buy insurance on the federal exchange, since job loss is a ""qualifying life event"" that gets you special access. those who otherwise lack coverage would normally have to wait until the regular open enrollment period, which takes place at the end of the year. but the threat of covid-19 has changed the risk for many of these potential shoppers.
 in response, 11 states have independently reopened their state-run health exchanges for a special sign-up period. but the administration has declined to take such steps for the national marketplace.
 ""if you have been uninsured and picked up your newspaper, or turned on your news and realized your health was in much greater risk than you had anticipated, and would like to rush and get health insurance in case you end up on a ventilator â youâre out of luck,"" said linda blumberg, a health policy fellow at the urban institute, a nonprofit research organization.
 even before coronavirus, the institute estimated that 32 million americans were uninsured. about 20 million of them could benefit from a special enrollment period, blumberg said. without insurance, coronavirus treatment poses not just a health risk, but also a financial one.
 the trump administration has said it will pay hospitals directly, out of a pool of $100 billion, to cover the cost of treating uninsured people with covd-19. after treating patients, hospitals would get paid at the medicare rate.
 but the administrationâs policy extends only to covering covid-19 treatment. uninsured people with underlying chronic conditions donât have a way to pay for health care, noted robert berenson, another urban institute fellow. if left untreated, those chronic ailments make covid-19 far more dangerous than it would be for someone able to get preventive treatment earlier on.
 coronavirus and the aca
 president trumpâs stance raises another question, experts noted. without the aca, what kind of impact would covid-19 have?
 even with the heath law intact, many americans wonât be able to find affordable health insurance. that particularly applies to people who canât afford the premiums on the individual marketplace, donât qualify for federal subsidies or live in one of the 14 states that didnât opt into the acaâs medicaid expansion provision.
 and the aca is nowhere near sufficient on its own, miller noted. having insurance is part of the picture, but it doesnât guarantee access to testing or that a hospital will be able to treat you. ""on the margins, it does help a little bit to have insurance coverage, but the problem is so much larger than that,"" miller argued.
 still, without the health law, the virusâs impact would be ""catastrophic,"" said jonathan oberlander, a health policy professor at the university of north carolina-chapel hill.
 striking the individual marketplace and medicaid expansion would leave almost another 20 million people uninsured â ""at risk for not only illness from covid-19, but also massive medical bills,"" said larry levitt, a vice president at the kaiser family foundation. (khn is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)
 without the aca, covid-19 could be considered a preexisting condition. insurance companies could charge more to cover people who have previously contracted the virus (assuming, of course, those people can get tested and recorded as having had covid-19). plus, emerging evidence suggests severe cases of covid-19 may leave lingering health consequences, that even after recovery would require ongoing medical care, levitt said.
 ""the acaâs consumer protections ensure that persons with covid-19 can obtain insurance without fear of being turned away or charged exorbitant premiums because of their preexisting condition,"" oberlander said.
 the health law also imposed strict regulations over what insurance must cover. without those regulations, plans could â and likely would â revert to skimpier coverage, blumberg said.
 that, she said, means plans that perhaps donât cover ventilators or branded medicines, or that cap how many days of hospital care theyâll cover, or that require people to pay much more out-of-pocket.
 ""insurers, given the legal ability to do it, would limit their legal liability and protect themselves from high claims,"" she said. ""they did it before and will do it again.""
 our ruling
 obama accused the trump administration and senate republicans of being ""willing to cut millions off their health insurance and eliminate preexisting condition protections for millions more, even in the middle of this public health crisis.""
 evidence indicates that this is an apt characterization. none have put forth a plan that would maintain coverage or consumer protections â policies that benefit millions of americans â if the supreme court rules against the aca. and as obama asserts, striking down the law without an equivalent replacement could be devastating, especially during the covid-19 pandemic. we rate this claim true."
1263,"west virginia university faculty members held a special meeting on sept. 1 to begin consideration of a proposal to strengthen the universityâs rules on the coronavirus by making vaccines mandatory on campus.
 during the meeting, one faculty member â kathryn moffett bradford, the division chief of pediatric infectious diseases at wvu's school of medicine â offered a statistic that she said supported the importance of getting vaccinated for the coronavirus.
 ""if you look at the hospitalizations at ruby memorial in west virginia, and around the country, 90% to 95% of those hospitalized are unvaccinated,"" she said. she was referring to j.w. ruby memorial hospital in morgantown, w.va., which is part of wvuâs health system.
 angela knopf, director of media relations and public affairs for j.w. ruby memorial hospital, confirmed to politifact west virginia that at the time the faculty meeting was held on sept. 1, about 90% to 95% of the patients hospitalized for covid-19 were unvaccinated. 
 moreover, knopf said that as of sept. 13, 2021, fully 100% of the patients in the intensive care unit at ruby memorial were unvaccinated. 
 how about the numbers nationally? the share of the unvaccinated in hospitals for covid-19 is also well above 90%. 
 as of aug. 2, 2021, more than 164 million people in the united states had been fully vaccinated and, based on reports from 49 u.s. states and territories, there were 7,525 breakthrough cases in which the person was hospitalized or died, according to the federal centers for disease control and prevention, we reported in august. that comes out to less than one-hundredth of 1%.

1265,"state sen. caleb rowden is disappointed with how boone county has handled $21.2 million in federal covid-19 relief funds. 
 ""boone countyâs online cares relief portal has fallen behind,"" he wrote sept. 4 on medium.com. ""over three months after receiving cares act relief funds from the state, the county has still not made those dollars available to help struggling mid-missourians."" 
 county commissioner janet thompson took issue with his statement. she said over $2 million was sent to two organizations: the boone county department of health and columbia public schools. 
 ""perhaps sen. rowden should actually contact the boone county commission to find out exactly what weâre doing,"" she said. 
 a dispute over facts? thatâs our specialty. 
 after digging into the question, we found that the county had not actually given out any cares funds by sept. 4, although some of the money has been promised. so when did boone county receive the money, and what happened to it?
 the money trail 
 when reached for comment, rowden pointed to a variety of sources to back his claim, including news articles published by the columbia missourian, a press release issued by the missouri governorâs office, and a summary of house bill 2014, which rowden voted for in the missouri senate.
 congress passed the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act on march 27. it gave money to states and missouri, in turn, gave some of those funds to every county plus st. louis city to help offset economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. the state bill that authorized disbursement of cares money, hb 2014, was signed into law by gov. mike parson on april 10. boone county received $21.2 million, which must be completely spent by dec. 31 or the entire amount will be returned to the state.
 parson announced may 4 that the money had been sent. two days later, boone county received the money.
 on july 16, boone county commissioners said they were looking at buying software to build a portal for relief applications from organizations and the general public. the commissioners said it would likely be ready within a month, according to reporting in the columbia missourian.
 on aug. 28, the missourian reported thompsonâs announcement that the online portal would be ready for applications within a few weeks. 
 at the time that state sen. rowden made his statement on sept. 4, the portal was not online. by sept. 9, the portal had been made available.

 so...whereâs the money?
 in an email, thompson said the commission had spent $2.1 million on requests from the boone county department of health, and to columbia public schools as a proxy to the other five school districts in boone county. 
 what did thompson mean by spent? ""if by âspent,â you mean out the door/in another entityâs hands, that is what was âspentâ as of september 6, 2020,"" thompson wrote.
 but was it? not according to the boone county department of health and county records. 
 on aug. 11, the columbia/boone county department of health and human services was approved to receive $1.8 million to hire 40 full-time employees through december. these employees included disease investigators, contact tracers, health educators, data analysts, and communicable disease specialists. the money was also to pay for additional covid-19 testing, especially for uninsured and under-insured individuals.
 health department assistant director scott clardy said in a sept. 11 interview that money had not yet been received from the county, as the health department had to submit an invoice to the county and later get reimbursed.
 meanwhile, all six boone county school districts requested $322,800 for 1,345 wi-fi hotspots. the county commission approved the request on aug. 20. the $322,800 was to be pre-paid by cps and reimbursed by the county. 
 according to district spokesperson michelle baumstark, the board of education approved the purchase agreement for the hotspots, using cares funding, on sept. 14. 
 the cares act money is designated to be sent out as reimbursements, upon ""provisionâ¦. of adequate documentation showing appropriately incurred expenses,"" according to the county orders that approved the money to both columbia public schools and the department of health.
 thompson said there were ""at least three requests in the works"" that, if fully funded, would exceed $11 million. but, thatâs anticipated money â not money spent, which was the basis of rowdenâs complaint.

 caleb rowden said: ""over three months after receiving cares act relief funds from the state, the county has still not made those dollars available to help struggling mid-missourians."" 
 evidence from the boone county department of health and county records back that up.
 we found that $2.1 million had been approved for two organizations that requested cares act funds. but that money had not been sent by the boone county commission at the time of rowdenâs post. although it was promised, the money had not hit the bank accounts of either organization.
 we rate this claim true."
1278,"the ideological split on in-person schooling during the pandemic was pretty predictable through most of 2020.
 those who generally favored lockdowns and other strong mitigation measures opposed in-person schooling, while those who derided lockdowns, mask orders and the like typically supported it.
 like much related to covid-19, however, positions have shifted on this issue as more data and studies have emerged.
 one prominent wisconsin republican says that research now supports a more widescale return to the classroom.
 ""it's time to get kids back in school,"" u.s. rep. mike gallagher, r-green bay, said in a dec. 7, 2020, tweet. ""new data shows in-person learning isn't driving spikes in cases, and school closures leave us with the worst of both worlds: students falling further behind without a significant impact on slowing the spread.""
 is gallagher right that in-person learning isnât driving a spike in cases?
 in a word: yes.
 the cost of online schooling
 the push against virtual schooling â embraced by most school districts starting in march â has strengthened as a growing body of research shows the toll being out of the classroom takes on learning.
 in fall 2020 assessments, students in grades 3 to 8 performed similarly to same-grade students last year in reading, but 5 to 10 percentage points lower in math, according to a november report from nwea, a research-based nonprofit group that assessed 4.4 million students.
 a november report from renaissance learning inc. similarly found students falling behind in math, with some grades 12 weeks or more behind.
 the move online has in many cases worsened existing socioeconomic achievement gaps as well, since online learning works only when students have consistent internet access and home support, according to research compiled by the economic policy institute and others.
 meanwhile, the science shows school doesnât present the risk many experts expected.
 what weâve learned from the schools that opened
 as with many other pandemic response measures, the diversity of local guidelines governing schools has created a natural experiment.
 ""children and schools are not the main drivers of the epidemic across countries,"" said a unicef report published in november. ""evidence shows that the net benefits of keeping schools open outweigh the costs of closing them. data from 191 countries show no consistent association between school reopening status and covid-19 infection rates.""

 an international research report out of spain found a similar lack of correlation, as did a study by insights for education that said there is ""no consistent pattern between school status and infection levels.""
 even dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, is now advocating for a measured return to in-class instruction.
 ""the default position should be to try as best as possible within reason to keep the children in school, or to get them back to school,"" he said on abcâs ""this week"" on nov. 29, 2020. ""if you look at the data, the spread among children and from children is not really very big at all, not like one would have suspected. so, let's try to get the kids back, but let's try to mitigate the things that maintain and just push â¦ community spread"" like capacity seating indoors at restaurants and bars.
 one project run by emily oster, an economist at brown university, has gathered data from 13 million in-person students (some multiple times) since september, in partnership with schools around the u.s. that data showed an infection rate of 2.2 students per 1,000 over a two-week period. the staff infection rate over that span was 4.2 per 1,000.
 (wisconsin was notably worse in both categories, averaging 7 infections per 1,000 students and 19 per 1,000 staff members)
 ""the numbers are small â smaller than what many had forecasted,"" oster wrote in an atlantic article detailing her early findings in october.
 cdc data shows children under age 18 make up about 10% of cases in the u.s., though they comprise 22% of the total population. (children account for just 0.1% of deaths.)
 the key asterisk is that in-person instruction is safest when mitigation measures remain in place in both schools and the community.
 the cdc recommends use of masks and following other guidelines such as social distancing, washing hands, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces in schools and buses. politifact missouri noted this in rating mostly true a claim that schools using these strategies ""remain among the safest places for our students.""
 jordan dunn, press secretary for gallagher, cited this research and fauciâs comments in defending gallagherâs statement.
 ""thatâs not to say there isnât transmission in schools and schools should re-open without common sense safety measures,"" dunn said in an email. ""but the data that has been collected suggests, as rep. gallagher states, that in-person learning is not driving spikes in cases and schools are not super-spreaders.""
 our ruling
 gallagher said, ""new data shows in-person learning isn't driving spikes in cases.""
 indeed, research from an array of sources in october and november show in-person instruction has not been tied to increased cases in those areas.
 key leaders including fauci have acknowledged classroom instruction caused fewer issues than expected, leading him to support a shift away from virtual learning.
 we rate this claim true."
1306,"during an april 15 virtual town hall meeting with front-line workers, former vice president joe biden, the democratsâ presumptive nominee for the white house, was asked by a meat processing worker what he would do to protect workers like her from covid-19.
 ""we lost a co-worker at my plant because there is no regulation to protect meat chain employees,"" said safaa elzakzoky, who is also a member of the united food and commercial workers international union. ""we canât work safely and get people the meat that they need to eat. so what would you do to protect a worker like my friend who just died?""
 in his response, biden called attention to steps taken by the obama administration during the h1n1 outbreak and criticized the trump administration. he focused on ""failures"" by the labor department and its occupational safety and health administration to use regulatory powers to protect workers, including oshaâs lack of action in enforcing specific worker safety guidelines related to covid-19.
 osha issued an advisory guidance in early march on how employers can protect workers from covid-19, which included encouraging businesses to develop infectious disease plans, to allow frequent hand-washing, to urge workers to stay home when they feel sick and to provide face masks to employees.
 biden asserted that the agencyâs actions fall far short.
 ""until this week, they werenât even enforcing these guidelines. still today, osha is not specifying which rules employees must follow or how to keep their workers safe and healthy,"" said biden.
 with president donald trumpâs coronavirus response emerging as a political flashpoint in the presidential campaign, we decided to dig into the administrationâs role in ensuring worker safety. and, as headlines increasingly detail how those on the front lines â health care workers as well as those in grocery stores and meatpacking plants and across the food supply chain â have contracted and died of covid-19, we thought it was important to check the veracity of bidenâs claim.
 we contacted bidenâs campaign to find out the basis for his response. staffers sent us an april 9 blog post from the national employment law project, an advocacy group for workers, that outlines how the trump administrationâs osha has failed to stipulate and enforce adequate employee protections during the pandemic. they also sent us oshaâs april 13 enforcement directive.
 what could osha do?
 osha is tasked with ensuring that workplaces are safe and healthy. the agency sets standards and has inspectors determine if workplaces are compliant. if they are not, osha issues citations and requires employers to address the problem within a certain timeframe. failure to do so results in fines or other sanctions.
 these standards tend to be broad statements that can take a decade to develop and implement. for instance, two obama-era osha officials â david michaels, the labor departmentâs assistant secretary for osha from 2009 to 2017, and debbie berkowitz, a senior osha official from 2009 to 2015 â told us they had worked on developing an infectious disease standard for years, but that effort was halted in 2017 by the trump administration. 
 however, osha also can issue an ""emergency temporary standard"" during a public health emergency, such as the current coronavirus pandemic.
 major unions, including the afl-cio and national nurses united, have petitioned osha for an emergency temporary standard that would codify that a variety of types of workers are at risk of exposure to covid-19 and issue detailed safety requirements for specific industries. so far, though, osha has not taken this emergency action.
 also, the march advisory guidance is not enforceable, said michaels and berkowitz. the guideline includes language stating that it is ""not a standard or regulation and creates no new legal obligations."" and though this document sketched out certain recommendations that would reduce workersâ risk of exposure to covid-19, when osha put out its april 13 enforcement directive, it didnât mandate that any of those recommendations be followed by workplaces or enforced by osha inspectors.

 michaels and berkowitz pointed out that oshaâs covid-19 directive is geared toward health care facilities, indicating that workplaces like food processing plants and grocery stores are untouched by the directive.
 but edwin foulke, who ran osha during part of president george w. bushâs administration, had a different take.
 since the agency has a limited number of inspectors, the focus on health care facilities is logical, he said.
 ""unfortunately, there is a death component to this virus, and obviously health care is the area where workers are most likely to be exposed,"" said foulke, now a partner at the fisher phillips law firm in atlanta and arlington, virginia.
 ""they put out the general publication on coronavirus, and now theyâre doing all these specific industry guidelines on how to deal with health issues. iâm not sure what more, looking at a real world scenario, they could do. what would it entail? and how is it going to help?"" he said. 
 for its part, an osha spokesperson reiterated that employers are, and will continue to be, responsible for providing a safe and healthy workplace and that oshaâs pre-existing standards remain in place and enforceable, as appropriate, to protect workers from coronavirus.
 what has osha done in the past?
 as part of answering the meat-processing plant workerâs question, biden pointed to his experience during the obama administration with the h1n1 pandemic in comparison to the current coronavirus response. to be clear, osha did not issue an emergency standard then, either. but the agency did offer detailed guidance â almost twice as long as the covid-19 enforcement document â on how to protect workers from h1n1.
 and, though the h1n1-specific issues raised in the directive also were not enforceable, the document included specific instructions for inspectors on how to use existing agency standards to identify h1n1-related safety hazards in workplaces.
 for example, the instructions included seven bullet points outlining situations specific to h1n1 in which a citation could be issued under the agencyâs general respiratory protection standard. in contrast, the covid-19 enforcement document does not give the same level of guidance.
 our ruling
 biden said that osha was not enforcing coronavirus guidelines until the week of april 13, and since then, the agency has not told employers what rules they must implement to keep workplaces safe.
 itâs true that osha did not release any covid-19 enforcement instructions for its inspectors until april 13. however, even when this directive was issued, it told inspectors to focus on its existing general safety standards, not recommendations geared toward the current outbreak. in other words, the coronavirus guidelines are not currently being enforced by osha.
 and while the agencyâs april 13 enforcement directive instructs inspectors to focus on general safety standards, it does not guide them on how specific recommendations for covid-19 â for instance, requiring masks and encouraging hand-washing â fit into such efforts.
 we rate bidenâs claim true.
 this story was updated to include comments from an osha spokesperson that came after the fact check was posted."
1308,"masks have once again become a political volleyball in the wisconsin state capitol.
 assembly republicans voted on feb. 4, 2021 to overturn gov. tony eversâ order requiring people to wear face coverings to mitigate the spread of covid-19 â sealing the deal after the senate took action a week prior. evers responded by immediately issuing a new mandate. 
 the next day, democrats in the assembly introduced legislation requiring masks, a measure that is likely to go nowhere in the gop-controlled legislature.
 amid the back and forth, democrats chastised their republican colleagues for playing politics with public health and argued masks are necessary to push the state through the final stages of the pandemic.
 among those to speak out was assembly minority leader gordon hintz.
 ""at the end of the day we know mask mandates work,"" the oshkosh democrat said in a feb. 5, 2021 interview on the wisconsin public television program here & now. ""thereâs enough evidence out there between counties that have done it and counties that havenât.""
 is hintz onto something? letâs take a look.
 mask mandates in kansas 
 when asked for evidence to support hintzâs claim, his office pointed to a study by the centers for disease control and prevention and kansas department of health and environment that analyzed the impact of mask mandates on kansas counties.
 kansasâ governor issued an executive order requiring face coverings in public spaces starting july 3, 2020. a state law enacted the month prior allowed counties to opt out of the state mandate, which 81 of 105 did without implementing their own mask rules. 
 researchers found the seven-day rolling average of new daily cases per 100,000 people decreased by 6% in the 24 counties with mask mandates after the governorâs order. in counties without a mandate, covid-19 incidence increased by 100%. 
 the study noted that 13 counties with mask mandates and seven counties without mandates also had other mitigation strategies in place, such as limiting the size of gatherings and how many could eat in restaurants. still, researchers concluded that ""strategies related to mask use mandates appear to be important.""
 ""the decrease in cases among mandated counties and the continued increase in cases in nonmandated counties adds to the evidence supporting the importance of wearing masks and implementing policies requiring their use to mitigate the spread of sars-cov-2,"" the study stated.

 additional research 
 the wisconsin medical society cited the kansas study in a feb. 1, 2021 memo to assembly lawmakers asking them to oppose the repeal. 
 the group also referenced research from goldman sachs estimating that mandates gradually increase the number of people who ""always"" or ""frequently"" wear masks by about 25 percentage points, and the number who ""always"" wear masks by 40 points.
 another study published in june 2020 found a ""significant decline"" in daily covid-19 cases in states with mask mandates, with the effect increasing over time. researchers cautiously estimated that 230,000 to 450,000 covid-19 cases may have been averted by may 22, 2020 due to the mandates. 
 meanwhile, researchers in canada found a 25 to 46% average weekly reduction in new cases in the first few weeks after mandates were adopted, while the number of people who reported always wearing a mask in public increased by about 30 percentage points. 
 when studying the impact of mask mandates, itâs important to consider whether people follow them and if theyâre enforced, said ajay sethi, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the university of wisconsin-madison. he said it can be difficult to assess mandates individually when theyâre issued with other public health guidelines, but he believes the kansas study offered compelling data on the matter. 
 ""you could argue that with or without a mandate, people might wear a mask because thatâs what they do and the mandate is just confirming what they do,"" he said. ""at the end of the day, an entire county had fewer cases.""
 and ultimately, sethi said, mandates remind people about the importance of wearing face coverings to guard against covid-19. 
 ""if we didnât have mandates, would you expect mask use to go up?"" he said. ""i wouldnât.""
 our ruling
 in a tv interview, hintz said, ""at the end of the day we know mask mandates work. thereâs enough evidence out there between counties that have done it and counties that havenât.""
 multiple studies have suggested mask mandates can lead to a decline in covid-19 cases. researchers caution that factors like compliance and enforcement should be taken into consideration, but masks have ultimately proven to be an effective tool in combating the virus. 
 we rate hintzâs claim true."
1337,"a viral post on reddit shows a dramatic photo of two people lying on the ground sick with covid-19 seeking treatment. one appears curled against a wall, while another patient draped with a paper medical gown is curled up, face down.
 ""everyone please be careful â whether you are vaccinated or not,"" wrote suzanne lopez on reddit where she posted the photo taken by her husband louie. ""my husband (vaccinated, but positive) has been waiting 2+ hours for monoclonal therapy and he says he has never seen people so sick. moaning, crying, unable to move.""
 
 the reddit thread drew hundreds of comments about the spread of covid-19 in florida, which has experienced a spike in cases this summer.
 ""i hate to see it, and i hate to say it, but we need more pictures like this showing the reality of the situation,"" wrote one reddit user.
 the idea that, more than one year into the pandemic, covid-19 patients in a major city in florida would be lying on a floor moaning for help seemed improbable. but itâs real, according to city and state officials.
 
 photo was taken at jacksonville regeneron site
 the photo was taken at one of multiple state-supported sites that opened in august to provide monoclonal antibody treatments that help covid-19 patients avoid hospitalization or death.
 nikki kimbleton, a spokesperson for the city of jacksonville, said in a written statement to politifact that the volume of patients seeking the treatment more than doubled in recent days at the jacksonville clinic, which is located at a public library. while the site provided 43 doses on aug. 16, that rose in the following days to 97, 143 and 155. 
 once the city realized the increase in patients seeking treatment, the city made sure the clinic had adequate supplies, including more wheelchairs, seats for patients waiting in line and signs directing patients to alert someone if they need assistance.
 louie lopez, who took the photo, told politifact that he was vaccinated in the spring. but about a week ago he came down with symptoms of nasal congestion and a headache and then tested positive for covid-19. lopez said his physician advised him to take regeneron, so he signed up for an appointment. 
 lopez told politifact he saw only a couple of chairs at the appointment site. he said that while he was waiting in line for his appointment, other people arrived including the two women in the photo.

 city and state officials sent us a tv news report by news4jax, which included an interview with toma dean, the woman lying face down on the floor.
 dean, of fleming island, told news4jax, that she was not vaccinated, and said that she had been suffering with covid-19 and pneumonia for two weeks. an emergency room doctor had advised her to get the monoclonal antibody treatment. 
 dean described herself as in ""very bad shape, light-headed, dizzy, shortness of breath. i couldnât stand at all."" she told news4jax that the staff at the library were excellent and scrambled to get wheelchairs. deanâs voice in the tv interview showed she was still sick, but she said she felt better after the treatment. (politifact was unable to reach dean directly.)
 ""this is real, guys,"" dean told news4jax. ""if you have it, i advise you to go get this therapy. go take advantage of the resources out there. get vaccinated. it may not be the first thing that you want to do, but it's better than the end result.""
 desantis has set up sites for regeneron across florida
 in november, the u.s. food and drug administration issued an emergency use authorization to tarrytown, n.y.-based regeneron pharmaceuticals inc. for regeneron to treat mild to moderate covid-19. the product consists of two monoclonal antibodies, which are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune systemâs ability to fight off harmful pathogens such as viruses.
 on aug. 10, 2021, the fda revised the authorization, allowing for emergency use of regeneron as a preventive drug for people who are exposed to the virus and are at high risk of developing severe covid-19. the agency said the treatment is not a substitute for vaccination. 
 florida gov. ron desantis has urged people to take the drug, which was used by former president donald trump after he became infected. both vaccines and regeneron are free for floridians. 
 the state of florida has ordered more than 7,000 doses in total from the federal government, said weesam khoury, a state health department spokesperson.
 our ruling
 a photo shows two covid-19 patients lying on the floor seeking treatment in florida. city and state officials confirmed that the photo was taken at a state-supported site in jacksonville where floridians can get a free regeneron treatment.

1351,"a new trump administration directive targeting international students at u.s. colleges is being challenged by universities in court â and by pundits on the cable news channels.
 the new immigration and customs enforcement guidance would bar foreign college students from staying in the country if they take all their courses online.
 international students enrolled at harvard university and other u.s. colleges that have moved fall-semester classes entirely online due to the coronavirus pandemic will have to leave the u.s. or transfer to a school with in-person teaching, according to the new rule.
 the rule, if put into effect, could trim the number of foreign students in the u.s. and at specific universities. it could also deal a blow to the u.s. economy, said msnbc host chris hayes, who argued on his primetime tv show that the policy has ""no upside.""
 ""higher education is one of america's strongest export sectors,"" hayes said, while displaying a chart on u.s. education exports. ""over 1 million international students studied at american universities, (in the) 2018-19 school year. they contributed over $40 billion to the economy.""
 hayesâ statistics are accurate. in 2019, u.s. service exports from education totaled roughly $44 billion, according to the bureau of economic analysis. that made education the sixth largest service export for the year, behind services such as personal travel and professional and management consulting, a spokesperson for the international trade administration said. 
 academic experts and representatives from nonprofits focused on international education also backed hayesâ claims. an ice spokesperson said hayesâ statement was accurate but declined to comment further due to pending litigation.
 ""higher education is one of the few areas in which we have a big surplus of exports over imports,"" said dick startz, professor of economics at the university of california, santa barbara, who wrote about the economics of education in a 2017 article for the brookings institution.
 education as an export
 all three of the statistics hayes cited are correct. 
 more than 1 million international students studied at u.s. institutions during the 2018-19 academic year, according to the institute of international education and nafsa: association of international educators, two nonprofits dedicated to international education.
 the two organizations reported that those international students contributed more than $40 billion to the u.s. economy during the year. experts said higher education can be considered an export because international students pay their tuition and living expenses to colleges and universities using money from abroad.

 ""international students are buying an american education,"" startz said. ""hence itâs an export.""
 exports from education amounted to roughly $44 billion in 2019, up from about $42.6 billion in 2018, according to the bureau of economic analysis. thatâs more than the u.s. made from exporting many other goods and services in the same timeframe. 
 education ranked sixth among service exports in 2019, the international trade administration spokesperson told us. it was fifth in 2018.
 those numbers make sense when you factor in the cost of college, said judith scott-clayton, professor of economics and education at columbia universityâs teachers college.
 ""if there are 1.1 million international students in the country, and each of them spends about $40,000 on u.s. tuition and living expenses, that gets you to $44 billion,"" she said.
 in an email to politifact, hayes also cited the international trade administration and an article in the new york times magazine in which an institute of international education adviser was quoted saying ""higher education is one of americaâs biggest exports.""
 but the article said u.s. schools were losing their international appeal for a number of reasons, including rising tuition costs and various policies enacted under president donald trump.
 rachel banks, nafsaâs senior director for public policy and legislative strategy, said in a statement that new international student enrollment is down over 10% since the fall of 2016, a trend nafsa estimates has cost the u.s. economy $11.8 billion.
 ""thatâs before the impacts of a global pandemic and related travel restrictions, several presidential proclamations targeting immigrants and nonimmigrants, and this guidance,"" banks said. ""therefore, we donât anticipate this downward trajectory to reverse itself anytime soon.""

 hayes said, ""higher education is one of america's strongest export sectors. over 1 million international students studied at american universities, 2018-19 school year. they contributed over $40 billion to the economy.""

1374,"accusations about the responsible party behind the united statesâ struggle to accelerate coronavirus testing have come from every which way and the blame has fallen, often inaccurately, on the shoulders of different public officials.
 in a march 13 tweet, president donald trump said the centers for disease control and prevention studied its testing system for decades but wasnât prepared for a large scale pandemic, an issue that was complicated by policy changes made by former president barack obama. 
 u.s. sen. chuck schumer, d-n.y., retweeted trumpâs remark and added his own comment: ""trump is once again trying to blame the previous administration for the number of tests available. this is his #dailylie."" 
 u.s. rep. dan crenshaw, r-houston, retweeted schumerâs remark and said: ""itâs not obamaâs fault and itâs not trumpâs fault. we have stringent fda regulations, long in place, that created barriers to the private industry creating a test quickly.""
 politifact looked at a different trump claim blaming obama for a lack of testing and rated it false. we also looked at a mostly false claim from democrat joe biden about the trump administration rejecting tests from the world health organization (they were never offered). trump also inaccurately stated that any individual who wants to be tested for the coronavirus can get a test â we rated that statement pants on fire.
 we wanted to dig deeper into crenshawâs claim, which attributes the delays in the availability of widespread testing to food and drug administration regulations.
 justin discigil, spokesman for crenshaw, pointed to articles from propublica, the new yorker, the atlantic and the washington post, all of which highlighted the role fda regulations played here.
 he added: ""just to be clear â nowhere did we say that these regulations were the sole/only reason for the testing issue, we said that they created barriers.""
 a timeline of events
 the first confirmed case of covid-19 in the united states came at the end of january, when a man in washington state developed symptoms after returning from a trip to wuhan. 
 one month later, federal health officials at the centers for disease control and prevention said it was inevitable that the u.s. would experience a spread of the virus and urged people to take precautions.
 in these early days of the virus, tests were not widely distributed to local and state laboratories. instead, testing for the new coronavirus was conducted almost entirely by the cdc â samples collected at the local level were sent to the agency.
 initial test kits developed by the cdc for use in local and state labs were flawed and produced inaccurate results in some labs, meaning they couldnât be distributed. as the agency worked to correct the tests, health officials turned to the fda. 
 the u.s. association of public health laboratories submitted a letter asking the agency to use ""enforcement discretion"" and authorize local and state labs to develop and use their own tests.
 during a public health emergency, labs and drug manufacturers must seek an emergency use authorization from the fda to use diagnostic tests and medical treatments that have not gone through the typical clearance process â to share them faster in the emergency.
 (these authorizations were begun in 2004 under president george w. bush.)

 for laboratory-developed tests, like the ones in question, fda policy has stated that they cannot be used in clinical diagnoses without the fdaâs approval during an emergency. 
 although the goal of these regulations is to ensure only accurate lab tests are conducted, health officials have said they prevented them from quickly responding to the virus.
 one doctor in a seattle lab described the process for getting an emergency use authorization from the fda and said the agency asked for a level of testing that didnât make sense in the context of an emergency, according to a gq profile.
 a doctor in north carolina told nbc news that she had developed a test using the world health organizationâs protocol but had yet to receive the use authorization from the fda, putting the state ""way behind"" in its ability to test patients. 
 on feb. 29, the fda announced a change in the process: labs would still need to seek the agencyâs approval for their tests, but the labs could begin testing while waiting for the official green light.
 on march 16, (three days after crenshaw made his claim) the fda announced another change to its policies and put state officials in charge of coronavirus tests developed by laboratories in their states, meaning labs would engage with state officials and not the fda. it also removes the requirement for these labs to apply for an emergency use authorization for their tests.
 the changes also expand which labs and manufacturers are included in fda guidelines and which kinds of tests can be developed.
 ""we believe the unprecedented policy set forth in todayâs updated guidance, which addresses laboratories and commercial manufacturers, will help address these urgent public health concerns by helping to expand the number and variety of diagnostic tests, as well as available testing capabilities in health care settings, and reference and commercial laboratories,"" reads a release from the agency.
 after the changes
 after the fda announced changes to its policies, labcorps and quest diagnostics both announced plans to start testing for the new coronavirus, crediting changes in federal policy with their ability to do so. 
 ""we applaud the fda for providing the flexibility for innovative, quality lab developed tests to be brought to patients and providers quickly to advance effective response to the coronavirus outbreak,"" said steve rusckowski, chairman and chief executive officer of quest diagnostics, in a statement.
 but even as state and local authorities move to ramp up testing, the number of available tests is still lacking. 
 in austin, for example, there is still a gap between available test kids and demand for testing, as officials prioritize testing for health care workers, people living in nursing homes and people at high risk for complications from the virus.
 our ruling
 crenshaw said in a tweet that longstanding fda regulations ""created barriers to the private industry creating a test quickly"" for the coronavirus.
 crenshawâs statement is accurate. fda procedures adopted in 2004 meant laboratories had to seek the agencyâs approval before developing and using tests in communities, a policy many health care officials have said prevented the country from taking early action in response to the novel coronavirus.
 it is important to keep in mind that other factors have contributed to the low levels of testing for the virus, beyond the fda regulations.
 but crenshawâs statement is accurate. we rate it true."
1381,"sen. pat toomey this week criticized president joe bidenâs proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, saying the direct payments biden wants to send americans are poorly targeted to those most in need. 
 ""there will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes whoâve had no income interruption whatsoever,"" toomey (r., pa.) said tuesday during a senate confirmation hearing for janet yellen, bidenâs nominee for treasury secretary. 
 we wondered just how much such families will receive if bidenâs plan is signed into law. 
 toomey is right. married couples making up to $150,000 annually would qualify for $2,800 in new payments, on top of the $1,200 they should have received this month from the relief package then-president donald trump signed into law late last year. 
 together, those payments would total $2,000 per person â the target democrats in congress set, trump made a late and unsuccessful push for, and that biden is now pursuing from the white house. 
 individuals making up to $75,000 would qualify for $1,400 in new aid on top of the $600 payments they just got. and adults with dependent children ages 16 and younger would qualify for an additional $600 per child. 
 analysts estimate this component of bidenâs plan could cost $465 billion.

 during the senate finance committee hearing, which took place the day before bidenâs inauguration, toomey argued against direct payments for upper middle class families who havenât endured any loss of income during the pandemic. 
 yellen acknowledged the payments arenât designed to target the people hurting the most, but rather intended to support families and stimulate the economy broadly. 
 ""some families presumably donât greatly need the money, but there are many families who are under stress,"" yellen told toomey. 
 the eligibility criteria for direct payments under bidenâs plan mirrors the one congress agreed to a few weeks ago, which set the upper income limit for the smallest payments at $174,000 for a married couple. 
 toomey told yellen it would be tough to find bipartisan support for bidenâs proposal, but several senate republicans have already endorsed the idea, including marco rubio of florida, josh hawley of missouri, and lindsey graham of south carolina. 
 democrats were first to pitch the idea of $2,000 per person direct payments, but it was trump who made a late push for them in december, threatening to withhold his support for the relief package unless the payments were included. he eventually relented and signed the package into law without the larger payments. 
 our ruling 
 toomey said families with six-figure incomes whoâve had no income interruption will get several thousand dollars in payments under bidenâs coronavirus relief package. thatâs right. couples who make up to $150,000 annually will get $2,800, plus $600 for each child age 16 and under, on top of payments received from the last relief package. we rate the statement true."
1405,"lt. governor dan forest thinks he would be a better governor than roy cooper.
 but cooper says forest hasnât put in the work needed to hold the office. the two went at it on oct. 14 in north carolinaâs lone gubernatorial debate.
 ""the lieutenant governor is on the state board of education where the state opening plans are discussed and voted on. and while iâm working with them and public health officials, heâs missed almost half of the board of education meetings during the pandemic,"" cooper said.
 forest responded by saying ""iâve been to almost every one of those meetings, especially every voting meeting. my staff sits in. my education experts and advisors sit in on all of those meetings, we donât miss a beat on an education meeting. we never have. weâve always been present at all of them.""
 so whatâs the truth here? 
 weâll rate cooperâs statement, since heâs the one bringing up the subject as an attack.
 he said forest has missed almost half of north carolinaâs education board meetings during the pandemic.
 as it turns out, cooperâs claim is almost spot-on.
 attendance record
 the board of education has not uploaded its meeting minutes since march. so we listened to audio files uploaded to youtube. then we asked the north carolina department of instruction for attendance records.
 cooper declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus on march 10, so weâre using that as the start date for the pandemic in north carolina.
 there have been 28 meetings since then, according to deanna townsend-smith, dpiâs director of board operations and policy. most of them were over an hour long, meaning the board has spent well over 24 hours talking about education policy just in the last eight months.

 forest has missed 13 of the 28 meetings, or 46%.
 forest missed meetings on march 18 and 27. he attended five meetings in a row before missing seven out of 10 from the beginning of may to the end of july. he then missed four in a row between sept. 3 and oct. 7.
 in some cases, forest arrived late to meetings but was still counted present. 
 ""present does not always mean attendance for the entire meeting, but present at some point and time,"" townsend-smith said.
 what forest missed
 itâs unclear why forest missed the meetings. neither his office nor his campaign responded to questions from politifact this week.
 forest said during the debate that his experts and advisors ""sit in on all"" of the meetings.
 staff members canât vote. and townsend-smith told politifact that board members ""cannot have anyone attend the meeting on their behalf.""
 forest ""may have had someone listening to the meeting on his behalf,"" she said, adding ""however that is not something that is within my purview and you would need to verify that with the lgâs office.""
 forest has downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, saying the state should reopen schools without a mask mandate. dpiâs records show forest missed votes that made changes to grading, testing and graduation requirements, set guidelines for remote learning, as well as another vote on grade point averages. 
 our ruling
 cooper said forest has ""missed almost half of the board of education meetings during the pandemic.""
 weâre not here to say whether or not forest should have attended the meetings. however, we can say whether cooperâs stat is correct.
 the state department of instruction says forest has missed 13 of 28 meetings since the pandemic started. that means heâs missed 46% of the meetings. 
 thatâs close enough to ""half"" for us. we rate cooperâs claim is true."
1420,"new york continues to be the epicenter of the novel coronavirus in the united states, with the lion's share of cases coming from, or around, new york city.
 the cityâs residents have been warned to stay home for weeks, with gov. andrew cuomo formally signing a state-wide ""stay-at-home"" order on march 20 that banned all non-essential businesses from conducting in-office work and stopped all ""non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason.""
 yet a photo shared on facebook april 2 showed an overcrowded nyc subway car along with a caption that seemed almost unbelievable during a time of extreme social distancing:
 ""this is nyc#2 train this afternoon!!!! and their mayor and governor wants to blame trump!!!! damn what a disgrace!!!! spread this far and wide!!!!""
 the image was flagged as part of facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (read more about our partnership with facebook.) 
 in this case, the post isnât far off â the image is real and was taken just three days earlier, during rush hour on a bronx-bound train on march 30.
 the photo was posted that evening on twitter by user hiam abbas, who wrote: 
 ""4:30 pm today, #2 bx bound train. trains are infrequent. all cars were this crowded. social distancing? containment? essential workers are at risk.""

 abbasâ post includes another photo of an overcrowded train, this one heading into manhattan during the morning commute.
 with ridership plummeting and fewer crew members working, new yorkâs metropolitan transportation authority announced implementation of its ""essential service plan,"" which aims to to help move healthcare workers, first responders and essential personnel while scaling back train and bus service overall; some lines are running on modified schedules and others arenât running at all.
 but public transit is a commuting lifeline for many essential workers, and the reduction in service can make it difficult to maintain the social distancing that health officials recommend.
 the mta responded to abbasâ photo on twitter, saying it would be ""escalated to supervision for investigation.""
 in an interview with the news channel new york 1 that same day, mayor bill de blasio said fewer people are riding the subway, so this kind of problem isnât typical. he said subway cars can get overcrowded sometimes due to a train breaking down or a service delay, but he also concluded that crowding on trains was ""not acceptable.""
 ""i understand people are trying to get somewhere, but no one should be getting on a crowded train,"" de blasio said. ""spread out throughout the train. wait for the next train.""
 according to a report by the new york times, although overall subway ridership is down 87%, the steepest declines have occurred in richer neighborhoods. 
 manhattan, which has a median income around $80,000, saw a 75% decrease in ridership, the times reports, while the bronx, where the median household income is about $38,000, saw only a 55% decrease. 
 the post is off on the date of the photo, but only by a few days; it was taken well into new yorkâs stay-at-home order. we rate it true."
1435,"gov. andrew cuomo, trying to calm fears amid the spread of the novel coronavirus, told reporters there are no plans to issue quarantine measures for entire cities. and if mayors are talking about that, they canât do it without state approval, he said. 
 ""mitigation is continuing and is ramping up,"" cuomo said on tuesday. ""there are many rumors out there - part of the fear, the anxiety. people spread rumors. well, maybe you're going to quarantine new york city. we hear new york city is going to quarantine itself. that is not true. that cannot happen. it cannot happen legally. no city in the state can quarantine itself without state approval, and i have no interest whatsoever and no plan whatsoever to quarantine any city.""
 later that day, new york city mayor bill de blasio said city residents should prepare for a shelter-in-place order, though he said the decision needs to be ""made together with the state."" 
 de blasio said that quarantine and shelter-in-place represent different approaches. ""shelter in place, to me, is a kind of way of life, if you will, and a more total strategy and quarantine suggests when you're dealing with a very specific, narrow area and who goes in and who goes out of that area,"" he said. 
 in an interview on wednesday with the daily podcast, cuomo said whatever itâs called, quarantine or shelter in place, heâs not interested. 
 ""that is not going to happen, shelter in place, for new york city,"" cuomo said. ""for any city or county to take an emergency action, the state has to approve it. and i wouldn't approve shelter in place. that scares people, right? quarantine in place - you can't leave your home. the fear, the panic is a bigger problem than the virus.""
 we wondered if a city or a county could unilaterally order its residents into isolation, whether by ordering a quarantine or shelter-in-place, or if cuomo is right in his claim that only the state can do that.
 we spoke with thomas merrill, who retired in january as general counsel for the state department of health and mental hygiene. 
 ""itâs a complicated answer,"" merrill said. ""local governments have the authority under state law to enact curfews and take other emergency actions. but state law also gives the governor emergency powers, including the right to suspend any law or local order he feels impends a response. so ultimately the state likely has the final say,"" he said. 
 ""the practical answer is they have to be working together,"" merrill said of local governments and the state.

 he directed us to state executive law section 24, which says that the new york state legislature can override a local action, and executive law section 29-a, which gives the governor power to override local laws or orders in a state emergency. in addition, cuomo issued an executive order on march 7, requiring that local actions be approved. 
 merrill was the top lawyer for the state department of health during the h1n1 pandemic, ebola outbreak, and a recent measles outbreak. he said that during a quarantine, specific people are told that they are confined at home. in some cases, during an ebola outbreak, police officers stood at patientsâ doors to ensure they did not leave, he said. but with covid-19, the novel coronavirus, the pandemic is past the phase when quarantines of specific patients would be effective in slowing the spread of the virus, he said. 
 whether the directive is to ""shelter in place,"" which is common during an active shooter situation, or ""quarantine,"" the goal is that people socially distance themselves as much as possible, merrill said. 
 other experts we spoke with said the state has broad powers. 
 generally, matters of public health are allocated to the state level, not the local level, said james a. gardner, suny distinguished professor at the university at buffalo. ""generally, the state is in a better position than a locality to make defensible decisions that restrict public travel on health grounds,"" he said. 
 we reached out to cuomo and de blasioâs press offices but did not hear back. 
 however, de blasio said in an interview on wednesday morning with today on nbc that any shelter in place order would need to be done in cooperation with the state. 
 ""itâs only a decision we would make with the state of new york, of course,"" de blasio said. 
 our ruling 
 cuomo said that cities do not have the power to order quarantines without state approval. 
 based on the powers of the state to override local orders contained in state executive law and in cuomoâs recent executive order, we rate his claim true."
1437,"gov. greg abbott followed 18 other republican governors on monday by rejecting federal pandemic unemployment benefits. 
 in a press release, a tweet and an appearance on fox news, abbott justified the decision by citing two figures that he argued illustrate the stateâs post-pandemic economic recovery. first, there are more job vacancies than people receiving unemployment benefits; and second, the number of job openings in the state today is significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. 
 ""i had the texas workforce commission dig into the numbers and provide me with the numbers, and here they are,"" abbott told fox news host bill hemmer on tuesday. ""we now have more job openings than we do people who are on unemployment. we have 60% more job openings today than we did the month before the pandemic hit the state of texas."" 
 abbottâs decision, which goes into effect june 26, will cut $300 weekly payments to unemployed texans by ending the stateâs participation in the federal pandemic unemployment compensation program. abbott also ended the stateâs participation in the pandemic unemployment assistance program, which provided self-employed people with aid throughout the pandemic. 
 as of march, the unemployment rate in texas stood at 6.9%, or nearly 970,000 people, which is down from the pandemic high of 13% in april 2020, according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics. the texas workforce commission reports that 1,029,890 million texans are currently receiving unemployment payments; about 31% of them are receiving aid as self-employed workers. 
 the stateâs withdrawal from the federal benefits programs comes at the urging of business leaders, who said that 60% of texas businesses were hiring for at least one position and blamed their hiring struggles on the $300 weekly aid payments. but are there more job vacancies in the state than unemployed people, as abbott claims? and how does the number of job openings today compare to pre-pandemic levels? 
 job vacancies 
 the texas workforce commission, which provided abbott with a job vacancy estimate at his request, explained how they determined this figure. 
 according to a spokesperson, the state workforce agency found that a combined 850,000 jobs had been posted to the agencyâs two state-run job boards â workintexas.com and mytxcareer.com. then, using third-party software, the agency combined this total with the number of texas job listings posted to private job boards like indeed and monster.com. 
 ""the exact point of the software is to determine the number of jobs without double counting, since most jobs are posted on multiple sites,"" said workforce commission spokesperson james bernsen. 
 according to this methodology, there were about 1,022,000 job postings in texas as of may 11, which is slightly less than the total number of people currently receiving unemployment benefits. 
 but the job vacancy total comes with one caveat, bernsen said. because a single job posting may have more than one job vacancy associated with it, the total number may be ""a bit deceptive,"" he said. however, the agency didnât provide an estimate for how this caveat may affect the 1,022,000 total.

 turning to abbottâs second claim â that the state has 60% more job openings today than in february 2020 â we look again at data from the texas workforce commission. 
 using the same methodology that determined the present number of job openings, the texas workforce commission found that about 645,000 jobs were available across the stateâs job boards and private job boards in february 2020. thatâs a 58.4% increase between the february 2020 number and the 1,022,000 job vacancies recorded on may 11. 
 
 
 the numbers donât satisfy critics 
 critics argue that low wages are to blame for employers' hiring difficulties rather than the $300 weekly unemployment payments. 
 rick levy, president of the texas afl-cio, a pro-labor group, has called abbottâs analysis too simplistic, and says that these computer-generated statistics ignore barriers to employment people continue to face. 
 ""a bunch of business people said they wanted this to happen, and thatâs why this is happening,"" levy said. ""and now [the governorâs office is] going back and backfilling their reason with this computerized approach."" 
 abbott said on fox news that he directed the workforce commission to ""dig into the numbers and provide me with"" job market data.
 we asked for a copy of this correspondence from the governorâs office but have not received a response. we also asked the workforce commission for a copy of the correspondence. an agency official instructed us to file a request under the texas public information act. that request has not yet been fulfilled. 
 ""labor is a commodity, and if there is a shortage of labor, just like when there is a shortage of anything else, then you raise the price on that commodity,"" levy said. ""there is a shortage because people are unwilling to do it and wages today are historically low. the profits in this economy have been sucked up by the top 1%.""
 our ruling 
 abbott said that there are now more job openings in the state than the number of people receiving unemployment benefits, and that the number of job openings today is 60% higher than the number recorded in the month before the pandemic. 
 based on texas workforce commission methodology, there are 1,022,000 job postings on state-run and privately run job boards, some of which represent more than one job. that should total slightly more than the 1,029,890 texans on unemployment as of the most recent data.
 furthermore, that 1,022,000 number is indeed about 60% higher than the 645,000 job openings the texas workforce commission counted in february 2020. 
 we rate this claim true."
1491,"louisiana gov. john bel edwards on cnn was asked whether mardi gras celebrations in his state should have been called off earlier this year, in light of louisiana now being considered a hotspot in the coronavirus pandemic.
 in new orleans, the carnival parades and celebrations started early january and ended feb. 25 on mardi gras (fat tuesday). itâs estimated that more than 1 million people go to new orleans annually for the carnival season and experts now believe the festivities fueled the outbreak.
 ""the biggest mardi gras parades in louisiana took place on feb. 25, just as the national outbreak was starting. in retrospect, if you knew then what you know now, would you have canceled mardi gras?"" cnnâs jake tapper asked edwards on april 5.
 ""well, you know you don't get a do-over like that, jake,"" edwards said. ""there was not a single suggestion by anyone, a doctor, a scientist, a political figure, that we needed to cancel mardi gras. and, you know, in february, we had a super bowl, and it wasn't canceled and so forth.""
 edwardsâ comments echoed a similar statement from new orleans mayor latoya cantrell 10 days earlier on cnn that there were ""no red flags"" from federal officials to suggest the festivities should be aborted.
 politifact wondered if itâs true that there were no suggestions back in january or february that mass gatherings like mardi gras be canceled.
 we reviewed statements from president donald trump, and guidance from federal and state public health agencies and found that edwards was right. public health professors in louisiana also told politifact that there was no suggestion, prior to mardi gras, of community spread in the united states, much less new orleans.
 the earliest suggestion we found from a federal agency saying that large events may need to be canceled came feb. 26, after mardi gras celebrations.
 messaging from trump
 on twitter and in public remarks, trump did not suggest that large public events be canceled. in india on feb. 25 and before leaving for india on feb. 23, trump said the coronavirus was very ""under control"" in the united states.
 trump tweeted about the virus at least eight times from january to feb. 25.
 his tweets generally said that his administration was in contact with china and others about the coronavirus, offered praise for chinese president xi jinpingâs handling of the outbreak, and said that his administration was monitoring developments and had it under control.
 on lundi gras, the day before mardi gras, he tweeted: 
 the coronavirus is very much under control in the usa. we are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. cdc & world health have been working hard and very smart. stock market starting to look very good to me!â donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) february 24, 2020 
 
 messaging from public health agencies
 when the u.s. declared the coronavirus a public health emergency on jan. 31, the government did not say that mass gatherings be canceled.

 throughout january and most of february, u.s. officials said that the coronavirus risk to the american public was low and that they were not seeing community spread of the virus. by feb. 25, there were 53 confirmed covid-19 cases in the united states and no deaths, according to data compiled by the world health organization.
 on feb. 26, the day after mardi gras, a centers for disease control and prevention doctor told reporters that the coronavirus situation was rapidly evolving and that the virus was spreading worldwide.
 there were still only a few cases in the united states and no reports of community spread, but that would eventually change, said nancy messonnier, director of the cdcâs national center for immunization and respiratory diseases. she said there were mitigation guidelines that people and communities could take during a pandemic when there wasnât a vaccine or proven medical treatment for the disease.
 ""on a larger scale, communities and cities may need to modify, postpone, or cancel mass gatherings,"" messonnier said. local communities would need to figure out which guidelines to implement and when, she said, based on the severity and the transmission of the disease and what could be done locally.
 on feb. 28, messonnier said it was possible that a reported case in california ""could be the first instance of community spread â meaning the illness was acquired through an unknown exposure in the community."" but it could also be that the patient was exposed through contact to a traveler who was infected, messonnier said. the immediate risk to the general american public remained low, she said.
 on feb. 29, a health official from washington state, where there were four presumptive cases of covid-19, joined a cdc press briefing and said the state was ""starting to see some spread in the community"" and the public risk was increasing. ""should we start to see more spread in washington, we might consider recommending measures like cancelling large public events,"" said kathy lofy, the state health officer at the washington state department of health.
 there were no reported cases of coronavirus in louisiana during the weeks-long carnival celebrations. the stateâs department of health in blog posts as late as feb. 21 said that the coronavirus threat to louisiana was very low and that people should be more worried about the flu. it recommended that people wash their hands and get a flu shot, since it was still flu season.
 louisianaâs first presumptive case of coronavirus was reported march 9, two days before the world health organization declared the new coronavirus a pandemic. on march 13, when louisiana had 33 presumptive positive cases of covid-19, edwards signed a proclamation to stop gatherings of more than 250 people and close all k-12 public schools statewide to slow the spread of the disease.
 based on models created mid-march, itâs assumed that infections silently spread in crowded parades during mardi gras, said susanne straif-bourgeois, an associate professor of epidemiology at louisiana state university health sciences center new orleans. soon after mardi gras, epidemiologists from nearby states began reporting confirmed cases of coronavirus in people who had traveled to new orleans for the festivities. but at the time that parade-goers gathered in streets with family and friends, it was not known that the virus was in the state, straif-bourgeois said.
 in his cnn interview with edwards, tapper said the washington post reported that governors had a gala in washington, d.c. in early february, and that a group of governors met with federal experts who gave ""the same dire warning that theyâre giving now.""
 maryland gov. larry hogan told the washington post, ""the doctors and the scientists, they were telling us then exactly what they are saying now.""
 edwards told tapper that in that feb. 9 briefing, ""we spoke generally about the novel coronavirus"" and that it was ""not accurate to say that they gave the same sort of information that they are providing right now,"" since a lot more is now known about the virus.
 edwardsâ deputy chief of staff, christina stephens, told politifact that at that briefing, the virus was described as low risk and there was no suggestion that large gatherings be canceled.
 in a feb. 9 press release about the briefing, the u.s. health and human services department said the task force ""reiterated that while this is a serious public health matter, the risk to the american public remains low at this time, and that the federal government will continue working in close coordination with state and local governments to keep it that way.""
 our ruling
 edwards said of the coronavirus threat, ""there was not a single suggestion by anyone, a doctor, a scientist, a political figure, that we needed to cancel mardi gras.""
 new orleans mardi gras celebrations began early january and ended feb. 25. politifact reviewed public comments from trump, federal and state health officials on and before feb. 25 and did not find suggestions that large public events be cancelled. at that time, there was no report of community spread of the virus.
 edwardsâ statement is accurate. we rate it true."
1498,"as u.s. airlines tell their employees to get vaccinated against the coronavirus or risk getting fired, one company says it wonât terminate its unvaccinated workers, according to a facebook post.
 the post is an image of text claiming southwest airlines ""will no longer terminate employees over the mandate.""""
 the post was flagged as part of facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (read more about our partnership with facebook.)
 but in this case, the post is accurate.
 
 
 
 most major airlines in the united states are requiring employees to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. the moves followed president joe bidenâs announcement in july that federal government employees and contractors would be required to verify their vaccination status. many airlines are considered federal contractors, and southwest has worked with the government to fly military personnel and mail for the u.s. postal service.
 southwest announced on oct. 4 that it would follow biden's vaccine directive, saying in a statement that employees ""must be fully vaccinated against covid-19, or be approved for a religious, medical or disability accommodation, by dec. 8, 2021, to continue employment with the airline.""
 eight days later, in an interview with ""good morning america,"" southwest ceo gary kelly said the company will follow bidenâs order, but wonât terminate any of its employees if they choose not to get vaccinated.
 ""weâre not going to fire any employees over this. we are urging all of our employees to get vaccinated,"" kelly said. ""if they canât get vaccinated, we are urging them to seek an accommodation.""
 the company said in a statement to politifact that it ""does not want anyone to lose their job over this mandate."" employees have until nov. 24 to submit proof that they are fully vaccinated or else request a religious or medical exemption. but according to comments kelly made oct. 21 in the companyâs third-quarter earnings call, neither that deadline nor the federal governmentâs dec. 8 deadline for contractors will result in southwest workers losing their jobs.

 under biden's order, unvaccinated individuals can continue to work as long as they wear a face-covering, physically distance themselves from other employees and customers, and undergo weekly covid-19 testing.
 meanwhile, united airlines announced oct. 13 that it was terminating 232 employees who refused to get vaccinated or seek an exemption by the companyâs sept. 28 deadline.

 a facebook post claims that southwest airlines will no longer fire its employees who choose to remain unvaccinated against covid-19.
 the company announced in early october that employees must be vaccinated or seek an exemption from the vaccine to continue employment.
 however, the companyâs ceo later said that no one will be fired over the vaccine mandate, and that the airline will encourage unvaccinated workers to seek an ""accommodation."" employees whose exemptions have not been processed or approved by dec. 8 will remain employed, and the company will adhere to covid-19 safety protocols as it encourages its unvaccinated workers to get the covid-19 vaccine, according to the companyâs spokesperson and its ceo.

1525,"after a primary campaign extended by the coronavirus, mj hegar was selected by democratic voters in texas to challenge republican u.s. sen. john cornyn in november.
 hegar celebrated her primary election win with a virtual victory party hosted on facebook, with appearances from state officials and members of the texas democratic party.
 during the event, hegar talked about the coronavirus and its impact in texas, stating that ""we had a health care crisis in this state before covid-19.""
 ""before the pandemic, nearly 1 in every 5 was without access to health care coverage,"" hegar said. ""and now: 1 in 3. nearly 1 in 3 texans under the age of 65 donât have access to health care insurance because of the record unemployment and because of our health care model that is failing texas.""
 texas consistently ranks as the state with the highest uninsured rates, but is hegar right about the number of people without insurance coverage during the coronavirus pandemic?
 pre-pandemic insurance levels
 hegarâs campaign shared multiple news articles about texans without health insurance published before and during the pandemic, including recent reporting from the houston chronicle highlighting how job losses are leading to a growing population of uninsured texans.
 letâs start with the rate of uninsured texans before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
 the kaiser health foundation, a nonprofit health policy research organization, publishes state health facts using detailed data from the census bureau, including the insurance status of people under 65 in texas.
 more than 4.8 million people under 65 are uninsured â about 19.9% of the population that age, or about 1 in 5 people, according to the latest census bureau data published in 2019.
 of those texans who are insured, about 66% are covered through their employer and 21.6% are covered by medicaid.
 texas is one of 13 states that has not expanded medicaid coverage under the affordable care act, which allows people between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (considered middle class) to receive tax credits to offset the cost of insurance plans purchased through an online marketplace.
 the act also grants free coverage under medicaid to anyone earning less than 138% of the federal poverty level (which this year is $26,200 for a family of four) in states that have opted to expand the program.
 since texas has not expanded the program, eligibility requirements for the program are more strict and are not based solely on income. in order to qualify, a person must have an annual income below a certain threshold ($51,876 for a family of four) and be pregnant, be a parent or caretaker of children, have a disability or a family member with a disability or be 65 years or older.
 pandemic insurance levels
 since texas first shut down segments of the economy to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the unemployment rate has fluctuated, spiking to a record 13.5% in april before falling to 8.6% in june.
 for comparison, in june of 2019 the unemployment rate in texas was 3.4%.

 as people lost their jobs, many also lost their health insurance coverage. the actual calculation of the number of people without coverage is a moving target, as people find new jobs or secure coverage elsewhere after becoming unemployed.
 but two national studies show that between 650,000 and 1.6 million texans could have lost coverage since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
 in may, the kaiser health foundation released a report estimating the number of people losing job-based health insurance coverage during the pandemic and how many of those individuals are eligible for coverage through medicaid or through the affordable care actâs marketplace tax credits.
 nationally, the report estimates that as many as 26.8 million people will become uninsured, including workers, adult dependents and children. of those, the report estimates that half are eligible for coverage through medicaid and others through tax credits.
 in texas, that report estimates that 1.6 million people will lose insurance coverage, which would bring the stateâs uninsured rate to about 26.5% for people under 65 â or about 1 in 4 people without health insurance coverage.
 but these figures donât speak exactly to hegarâs claim, which is about the number of people who ""donât have access to insurance."" 
 even though texas has opted not to expand medicaid coverage to people with incomes below the poverty line, the report states that unemployment benefits and the temporary $600 weekly payments approved by congress are likely to push annual income for many of these unemployed workers to levels that would make them eligible for medicaid coverage in texas.
 this means they will be able to access medicaid coverage and marketplace tax credits for the remainder of the calendar year.
 other people who lose coverage could switch to insurance offered through a spouseâs or parentsâ employer and others may qualify for coverage but opt not to enroll, according to the report.
 so even though an estimated 1 in 4 texans will now be without health insurance coverage, the actual number of people who are uninsured and ""donât have access to healthcare insurance"" is likely even lower.
 a july report from families usa, a research and advocacy non-profit that supports policies that make healthcare more accessible, offers a closer estimate. 
 the report tried to pin down the number of uninsured adults who would be unable to obtain new health insurance coverage after losing employment during the coronavirus pandemic.
 the report estimates that about 5.4 million people across the country became uninsured after losing their jobs between february and may of this year and could not find new coverage.
 in texas, an estimated 659,000 adult workers lost insurance coverage after losing jobs and could not find coverage elsewhere, bringing the rate of uninsured adults in the state at the end of may to 29%, or about 1 in 3 adults, the report found.
 but these figures are just about workers, and donât account for children and other dependents who may have been covered by another adultâs health insurance plan through an employer, which means the total number of people who are uninsured is likely higher than this estimate.
 our ruling
 hegar said 1 in 5 texans did not have health insurance coverage before the pandemic, and now ""nearly 1 in 3 texans under the age of 65 donât have access to health care insurance.""
 hegar is right about how many texans under 65 were previously uninsured. the number of texans without access to health insurance during the pandemic is harder to pin down, but her ""nearly 1 in 3"" remark reflects the latest available estimates.
 we rate this claim true."
1530,"richmond mayor levar stoney recently said virginia needs to dramatically expand covid-19 testing before it reopens its economy.
 ""weâre not doing the kind of real-time, instantaneous testing that i think we need to do in communities throughout the commonwealth of virginia,"" stoney, a democrat, said during an april 10 interview on newsradio wrva. ""weâve lagged behind other states when it comes to testing.""
 we fact checked whether virginia really is trailing in coronavirus testing.
 jim nolan, stoneyâs communications director, said the mayor got his information from the coronavirus resource center at johns hopkins university, a widely-cited website for covid-19 data. on every day in mid april, it shows virginia ranked either 49th or 50th among states in covid-19 testing per capita.
 on april 21 - the date of this writing - virginia was last. it had conducted 58,394 tests, or, on a per capita basis, 738 tests per 100,000 residents. the next lowest was california, at 747 tests per 100,000.
 across the u.s., 1,168 tests had been conducted per 100,000. new york, hardest hit by covid-10, had tested a leading 3,851 per 100,000. 
 hereâs how virginia compared to its neighbors, in number of tests per 100.000:
 
 
 west virginia, 1,514;
 
 
 tennessee, 1,479;
 
 
 maryland, 1,142;
 
 
 kentucky, 941;
 
 
 north carolina, 794;
 
 
 virginia, 738. 
 
 
 on april 10, when stoney made his statement, virginia was 49th in per capita testing, leading kansas.

 while virginia has been at the bottom in testing, other johns hopkins data shows it ranks in the middle in the spread of the disease. on april 21, there had been 110 infected virginians per 100,000. thatâs 21st per capita.
 the controversy
 testing numbers have a huge role in debate in virginia and across the country over when governors should ease their stay-at-home restrictions and allow widespread business reopenings.
 president donald trump has called for lifting restrictions and is urging supporters to ""liberate"" several states where democratic governors issued the orders. that includes virginia, where gov. ralph northam's order lasts until june 10. virginia has seen several recent protests demanding northam open the state now.
 northam, a pediatric neurologist, says he set the date cautiously, noting that some projections show the virus may not peak in virginia until late may. he recently appointed a work group to ramp up virginiaâs testing. ""the ability to run large numbers of tests is key to lifting restrictions on businesses and gathering,"" northam said at an april 20 news conference.
 northamâs explanation
 the governor and his advisors say theyâve had trouble competing with other states for scarce testing supplies. ""weâre scouring the country for the equipment to help our institutions increase testing,"" daniel carey, virginiaâs secretary of health and human resources, said on april 17. ""we just havenât been successful because of the national shortage, but we realize we have to get significantly more testingâ¦""
 northam says trump has given ""limited guidance"" on how states can work through the competition.
 many governors have voiced similar complaints. the northam administration also gives reasons that may be unique to virginia.
 commissioner of health norman oliver says virginia had a slow start because - unlike some other states - no virginia hospitals or labs developed their own tests. that meant, for a while, virginia had to rely almost solely on the state lab for testing. the state lab was so crunched, oliver says, that it set guidelines that limited testing to the most vulnerable patients. as a result, he says, many virginia physicians didnât seek tests for patients showing mild covid-19 symptoms.
 carey also says virginiaâs method of reporting tests may create a time lag that hurts virginia when compared to other states.
 northam says virginiaâs has improved as the stateâs private labs, universities and hospitals have begun creating their own tests. during the first three weeks of april, the total number of tests conducted in virginia has quadrupled. many states have seen similar expansions.
 northam told clinicians this week they should start testing anyone whoâs symptomatic. and the stateâs now testing all patients and workers in extended-care facilities.
 our ruling
 on april 10, stoney said virginia has ""lagged behind other states when it comes to (covid-19) testing."" 
 on any given date from the eve of the mayor's statement through this april 21 writing, virginia has been last, or next to last, in per capita testing. so we rate stoneyâs statement true."
1549,"months into the coronavirus pandemic, much remains unknown about the virusâ origins, transmission and longevity.
 but the need for more testing is a point of near unanimous agreement among health officials, scientists and members of both political parties. itâs the pathway to better understanding how far the disease has spread, how common severe cases are and how best to address it.
 so is the president pushing to limit testing?
 a new attack ad from priorities usa targeting wisconsin and other battleground states makes that claim with a series of quotes from president donald trump. over the mandatory ominous music, the ad plays four trump quotes asserting testing is making america look bad, so we should slow it down.
 
 
 
 
 
 ads in this style have been known to pull quotes out of context or rearrange them chronologically to create a more compelling narrative.
 that didnât happen here.
 america has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in the world â with 2.3 million as of june 24, 2020 â and has also done the most testing in the world, in terms of raw numbers. across the nation we are conducting about 500,000 tests per day now, double where we were in early may, according to covidtracking.com.
 that said, many countries have done more testing on a per-capita basis, as detailed by johns hopkins university. throughout the pandemic the u.s. has averaged about 56 tests per day per 100,000 people. germany, canada, spain and australia have all tested at a higher rate, and russia and qatar are among a handful of countries that have topped 100 daily tests per 100,000 people.
 trump has boasted of the volume of testing in the past, saying americaâs testing is the best in the world and that the high number of confirmed cases is a ""badge of honor.""
 but since may, the president has also increasingly pushed back against testing, calling it ""overrated"" and noting the bad optics associated with the higher case counts. he took that line of reasoning a step farther in his latest comments, as detailed in the ad.
 here are the four quotes in context.
 âby doing all of this testing we make ourselves look bad.â
 trump said this may 6, 2020, during a meeting with iowa gov. kim reynolds.
 the quote
 ""the media likes to say we have the most cases, but we do, by far, the most testing. if we did very little testing, we wouldnât have the most cases. so, in a way, by doing all of this testing, we make ourselves look bad.""
 the context
 reynolds â a republican â responded to trump by highlighting the importance of testing: ""that really provides us the data we need to understand the virus activity better."" trump, meanwhile, has made numerous similar comments, including a june 19, 2020, wall street journal interview where he called testing ""overrated"" and said ""in many ways, it makes us look bad.""
 âwhen you test you find something is wrong.â
 trump said this may 14, 2020, during an appearance in pennsylvania.

 the quote
 ""donât forget, we have more cases than anyone in the world, but why? because we do more testing. when you test, you have a case. when you test, you find something is wrong with people. if we didnât do any testing, we would have very few cases.""
 the context
 trump asserts there would be fewer cases if there were less testing. of course, less testing would simply mean officials are aware of less cases, or there would be fewer identified cases â it wouldnât mean fewer cases exist. 
 but this line of thinking is consistent with other comments from the president, including a may 15, 2020, event where trump said, ""if we didn't do any testing, we would have very few cases,"" and ""maybe it (testing) is overrated.""
 ""testing is a double-edged sword. â¦ so i said to my people, slow the testing down please.""
 these statements, used separately in the ad, are both from a june 20, 2020, rally in oklahoma.
 the quote
 ""you know, testing is a double-edged sword. weâve tested now 25 million people. itâs probably 20 million people more than anybody else. germanâs done a lot. south koreaâs done a lot. they called me, they said the job youâre doing (trails off). hereâs the bad part. when youâre testing to that extent, youâre going to find more people, youâre going to find more cases. so i said to my people, âslow the testing down, please.â""
 (note: the u.s. has conducted more tests than any other country in terms of raw numbers, but the ""20 million â¦ more than anybody else"" is wrong. russia has conducted more than 17 million tests, according to tallies from our world in data)
 the context
 various white house officials claimed trump was speaking in ""jest"", was ""obviously kidding"" or was speaking ""tongue in cheek"" about slowing down testing. trump himself has responded to this assertion multiple ways.
 on june 23, 2020, he was asked specifically if he was kidding about slowing down testing. he responded, ""i donât kid. let me just tell you. let me make it clear,"" then went on to talk about america having ""the greatest testing program anywhere.""
 but in an interview that day with fox news, trump responded to a question â ""but you donât mean, do you mean slow down testing?"" â by backing away from the statement and reiterating the idea that the u.s. would look better if it tested less. 
 ""no i donât mean slow down, but if we did slow down â¦ letâs say instead of 25 million tests we did 5 million tests, weâd be very low in cases right now, and everyone would say, âisnât that wonderful,â"" trump told ""fox & friends.""
 dr. anthony fauci â part of the national coronavirus task force â said that day in testimony before congress the federal government is trying to expand coronavirus testing, not slow it down. fauci told the house energy and commerce committee, ""none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing.""
 our ruling
 an attack ad targeting various battleground states quotes trump as saying testing makes the u.s. look bad, ""so i said to my people slow the testing down.""
 video recordings show he did indeed say these lines, and in the order presented. and the overall impression created by the ad is consistent with trumpâs messaging over the preceding month and a half.
 as health officials and politicians alike have pushed for more testing, trump has expressed increasing doubts as to its importance, progressing from calling it ""overrated"" to calling for the slow down. though white house officials defended that as a joke, trump at one point contradicted that, while at another saying he didnât mean it.
 we rate this claim true."
1583,"during a recent press briefing regarding covid-19 in new york state, gov. andrew cuomo said the economy must be reopened and that people need to get back to work. but, he said the rate of infection is currently being kept down because people are staying in their homes. 
 ""and if you start acting differently, you will see a corresponding increase in that rate of infection. and the worst scenario would be if we did all of this, we got that number down, everybody went to extraordinary means, and then we go to reopen and we reopen too fast or we reopen and thereâs unanticipated consequences, and we see that number go up again,"" he said. 
 he warned that people who think he is being ""hyper-cautious"" should look at what is happening in other countries and their responses to the new coronavirus. 
 ""go look at other countries that went through exactly this, started to reopen, and then they saw the infection rate go back up again,"" he said. 
 since talk of reopening, and the possible dangers of doing so, dominates headlines across the united states and around the world, we wondered about whether other countries have already experienced a second surge in infections after relaxing lockdown orders for people, schools, businesses, and borders. 
 experience elsewhere
 in asia, authorities have been dealing with covid-19 for more months than the united states has, and they have more experience in responding to the virus. 
 in some cases, the number of infections in a city or country has increased after welcoming inbound travelers, or after a relaxing of social distancing measures. 
 in hong kong, an early response seemed to contain the virus, and then life resumed as people returned to work and restaurants. 
 ""with most everyoneâs guard down, the predator lashed back last week. cases of covid-19 surged,"" stat news reported on march 26. the government ordered people back home, and closed facilities that had been reopened. 
 in hong kong, it ""soon became clear that while the majority were coming from overseas, quarantine measures in place were not sufficient, and local transmission had resumed,"" cnn reported on march 23.

 in hokkaido, japan, an island prefecture, social distancing measures were relaxed, and then there was a sudden increase in new coronavirus cases, according to news reports. 
 ""hokkaido declared a three-week state of emergency in february that was lifted on march 19,"" npr reported. ""the prefecture had begun to reopen schools and was even allowing carefully orchestrated public gatherings. but the latest order reverses all that, asking residents once again to refrain from nonessential trips outside their homes and closing prefectural primary and secondary schools until may 6.""
 unlike in some other asian countries, there was no evidence that the uptick in hokkaido was because the virus was re-imported from outside japan, the bbc reported. a lack of testing also contributed to health authoritiesâ inability to track and contain the virus, according to the bbc. 
 there is a surge in coronavirus cases in singapore, which is concentrated in foreign worker dorms, where people live in close quarters. it's not clear whether the migrant workers arrived with the virus, or if it had been circulating among that population for some time, cnn reported. 
 singapore has had to impose stricter measures to contain the virus. 
 we consulted with an epidemiologist at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health, on what is happening in singapore, hong kong, and hakkaido, japan, and whether cuomoâs statement is accurate. 
 ""we are definitely seeing rises in cases in those places,"" said stephen kissler, ph.d., a research fellow in the department of immunology and infectious diseases. kissler is a co-author of a paper that stated that ""prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022."" he said he is hesitant to link the increase solely to lifting social distancing measures, because there are a lot of reasons cases could rise after a period of sustained low transmission. 
 ""but on the whole i would say that the statement is correct,"" kissler said. 
 our ruling
 cuomo didnât say that all countries had increased infections after they reopened, and he also didnât say explicitly that reopening caused the increase in the statement we fact-checked. he said that people who are anxious to reopen should be aware that there are cases where other countries reopened and then saw the infection rate increase. 
 there have been reports of increased infection rates in some countries that reopened. 
 we rate cuomoâs claim true."
1587,"we may be months â at least â away from a vaccine to protect against covid-19, but in the meantime the public is turning its eyes to drugs that could be used to treat it. 
 among the first to be lauded as a possible solution was the antiviral drug remdesivir, which attacks the coronavirus to prevent it from making copies of itself and spreading. a clinical trial run in april found that patients who took the drug were more likely to recover from the disease â and do so faster â than patients who took a placebo pill. 
 but as excitement about remdesivir amps up, criticism has followed over the price that gilead sciences, the drugâs manufacturer, wants to charge for it. 
 u.s. insurers, including medicare and medicaid, will pay $3,120 for a five-day course of the drug, while other developed countries will pay about a third less because theyâll purchase from generic manufacturers to which gilead has licensed production. 
 the move has angered many, including the progressive advocacy group and think tank public citizen, which tweeted on june 29, 2020 about the price declaration, writing, ""taxpayers spent $70,000,000 to develop this drug. it should be in the public domain. instead, big pharma is robbing us blind.""
 parts of the tweet, course, are opinions. but the $70 million claim is stated as a fact.
 how much did taxpayers spend to develop remdesivir? 
 letâs dig in. 
 remdesivirâs ties to public funding 
 to back up the organizationâs claim, peter maybarduk, public citizenâs access to medicine director, sent a may 7, 2020 post published on their site titled, ""the real story of remdesivir.""

 amid the worldwide ebola outbreak in 2015, the u.s. government partnered with gilead to identify a drug that targeted the ebola virus and was successful in blocking the infection in rhesus monkeys. 
 that drug would later come to be known as remdesivir. in 2017, a u.s. department of health and human services report noted that an entity within the department of defense would cost-share with gilead for ""continued development of this product,"" noting its antiviral activity against a number of viruses, including coronaviruses. 
 the department of defense has spent $34.5 million so far on this effort. 
 also in 2017, the national institutes of health issued a $6 million grant to researchers at the university of north carolina to speed the development of remdesivir. 
 and as the novel coronavirus made its way into the world, the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, a division of nih, announced it would funnel $30 million into the aforementioned clinical trial for remdesivir. 
 since the department of defense and the national institutes of health are funded through federal taxes, these three payments add up to what public citizen claimed. 
 our ruling 
 public citizen wrote that taxpayers paid $70 million to develop remdesivir. 
 three separate projects from agencies that are funded by taxpayer dollars, adding up to $70 million, have commenced since 2015. 
 we rate the claim true."
1643,"to prevent the spread of coronavirus, one state lawmaker wants to take the ""assembly"" out of the north carolina general assembly.
 north carolina state rep. kelly alexander, a democrat from mecklenburg county, suggested on twitter that legislators should consider video conferencing. the start of the legislatureâs session is scheduled for april 28.
 alexander posted his tweet on march 11. that same day the world health organization labeled the spread of the novel coronavirus as a ""pandemic,"" prompting a wave of event cancellations and changes across the globe.
 ""with a vaccine a year in the future the general assembly should use more teleconferences and fewer in person meetings to cut down on potential exposure...after all most of the gaâs members are in the high risk age group,"" alexander tweeted, adding: ""besides we need to modernize...just saying.""
 
 is it true that ""most"" of north carolinaâs legislators are in the ""high risk age group?""
 alexander never responded to an email from politifact, so we donât know how he came to his conclusion.
 regardless, his tweet is on-point.
 at-risk ages
 first, letâs first look at what health experts say about the novel coronavirus (also known as covid-19) and whoâs most at-risk. 
 the virus causes a fever, cough and shortness of breath in people anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure, according to the the centers for disease control and prevention. the cdc says people with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease are most at-risk.
 as for age, thereâs no specific birth date at which people become more vulnerable. generally speaking: the older you are, the more likely you are to have complications from the novel coronavirus.
 that said, top health organizations have defined ""older adults"" as people who are at least 60 years old.
 the cdc has previously, in a document unrelated to the coronavirus, defined older adults as those over 60. the world health organization specifically mentioned people over 60 in its recent report on the coronavirus outbreak in china.

 health experts recently told cnn that the term ""older"" typically refers to anyone over 60. and us surgeon general jerome adams said 60 is the ""average age of people who need medical attention.""
 it also appears that people older than 60 are more susceptible to complications from the virus.
 scientific american reported that patients in china were more at-risk of death if they developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, known as ards, after contracting coronavirus. the average age of those who contracted the syndrome was 61.
 state lawmakers
 so we know that people who are 60-years-old or older are likely to be more at-risk than other age groups. with this in mind, letâs look at the age of north carolinaâs legislators. 
 the legislature includes 170 members: 120 in the house and 50 in the senate.
 in the senate, 28 members are 60-years-old or older. in the house, 63 members are older than 60.
 that means 91 members are aged 60 or older -- which is 53% of the general assembly.
 those numbers come from james white, the house principal clerk, and sarah holland, the senateâs principal clerk.
 so itâs true that a majority of legislators are 60 or older. 
 how does that compare to congress?
 in the u.s. house, 197 of its 435 members are 60 or older. in the u.s. senate, 66 of its 100 members are 60 or older. that means about 49% of congress is at least 60 years-old.
 those numbers come from a report by the congressional research service and jennifer manning, the serviceâs senior research librarian.
 our ruling
 rep. alexander said ""most"" north carolina legislators are in the ""highest risk age group"" for coronavirus.
 the highest risk age group is generally people who are aged 60 and older. alexanderâs claim is on-point: more than half of legislators are older than that. we rate his claim true."
1655,"when north carolina legislators returned to the capitol, the house minority leader showed up wearing a surgical mask bearing the state flag.
 health experts recommend that americans wear face masks while in public to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, which can be transmitted through aerosol droplets.
 so darren jackson, the democratic leader in the gop-controlled state house, has urged his colleagues to do the same. and on may 27, jackson offered some advice for president donald trump.
 ""two thirds of americans disapprove of donald trump not wearing a face mask in public, and the vast majority supports elected officials being required to wear masks in government buildings,"" jackson tweeted.
 
 is he right about the polling on trump?
 overall, yes: polls show that most poll respondents believe the president should wear a mask, though the level of support varies by political affiliation.
 what polls show
 when we reached out to jackson, he cited an online survey of 1,012 people by navigator research, a pollster that works with democratic and progressive clients.
 their poll question asked, ""do you approve or disapprove of donald trumpâs decision not to wear a face mask while in public?"" 
 of the group, 27% said they approve, and 65% said they disapprove.
 this poll was conducted using an opt-in system, with respondents volunteering to participate. however, the data was weighted for ""a variety of demographic variables"" to approximate the national registered voter population, the firm said.
 a look at other polls using a variety of survey methods found similar results when asking whether trump should wear a mask in public.
 the navigator poll stands out because it asked people whether they approved of trumpâs decision, while other polls asked about masks without mentioning his behavior. still, the results were comparable.
 here's what they found:

 quinnipiac poll between may 14-18: 67% support
 
 
 huffington post and yougov poll over may 14-16: 63% support
 
 
 politico and morning consult poll between may 8-10: 70% support
 
 
 kaiser family foundation poll conducted may 13-18: 72% support
 
 
 the quinnipiac and kaiser polls used phone calls, while the huffpost/yougov and politico/morning consult polls were online.
 partisan differences
 the most obvious divergence of views comes from partisan identification.
 while these surveys consistently show overall support for trump wearing a mask, republicans are far less enthusiastic. hereâs the amount of support for the idea from republicans in each poll:
 
 
 quinnipiac: 38% support
 
 
 huffpost/yougov: 46% support (with 44% among ""trump voters"")
 
 
 politico/morning consult: 58% support
 
 
 kaiser family foundation: 48% support
 
 
 the huffpost/yougov gave respondents the option to answer ""i donât care either way,"" which was the most common answer among republicans and trump voters.
 so, among these four polls, support for trump wearing a mask ranges between 63% and 72% among all types of voters, but it drops to between 38% and 58% among republicans. and the navigation research poll found that 54% of republicans approve of trumpâs decision not to wear a mask.
 our ruling
 jackson said ""two-thirds of americans disapprove of donald trump not wearing a face mask in public and the vast majority supports elected officials being required to wear masks in government buildings.""
 in each of five polls, between 63% and 72% of all respondents said trump should wear a mask. we rate the claim true."
1657,"gov. roy cooper has kept gyms and fitness centers closed during the coronavirus outbreak, drawing criticism from his republican challenger.
 the number of covid-19 cases and hospitalizations has been steadily rising in the tar heel state, according to the north carolina department of health and human services.
 cooper has said he worries that the heavy breathing associated with exercise could increase the spread of the virus. but lt. gov. dan forest, the republican who hopes to unseat cooper in november, criticized the governor for picking pandemic ""winners and losers.""
 on monday, forest said north carolina is one of only a fraction of states keeping gyms closed.
 ""now, 46 states have gyms/fitness centers open - north carolina is one of four states that does not,"" forest tweeted. 
 
 is that true?
 generally speaking, yes. some states are taking a regional approach to reopening gyms. in those states, gyms are allowed to open in some counties but not others. massachusetts, new jersey, new york and north carolina are the only states where governors are keeping gyms closed across the board.
 tracking reopenings
 our review of virus-related executive orders tracked by cnn, the new york times, the washington post and the national governors association backs up forestâs assessment.
 our review of these websites found that massachusetts, new jersey, new york and north carolina are the only states keeping gyms closed across the board.

 most other states have either reopened gyms with restrictions, or reopened gyms in some areas but not others. for example, in california, gyms are allowed to reopen in all but seven counties.
 in pennsylvania, 54 of the stateâs 67 counties had entered a ""green phase"" by june 19, meaning gyms could reopen at reduced capacity. but 13 counties remained in the ""yellow phase,"" meaning their gyms were still closed.
 things are moving a little slower in washington, where less than half of the stateâs 39 counties have entered phase 3. thatâs the phase when gyms can reopen at less than 50% capacity, according to the seattle times.
 in michigan, gov. gretchen whitmer allowed some gyms to open on june 10, while others remained closed because they didnât meet the stateâs qualifications to reopen. but a federal judge recently halted the order, allowing all gyms to open on june 25. theyâll remain closed if whitmerâs appeal is successful.
 a similar situation happened in wisconsin, too. gov. tony evers didnât lift his ban on gym operations. the ban was dissolved after the state supreme court struck down his stay-at-home order.
 our ruling
 forest tweeted that ""46 states have gyms/fitness centers open"" and that ""north carolina is one of four states that does not.""
 our review found that north carolina, new jersey, new york and massachusetts are the only states where gyms remain closed across the state.
 itâs worth noting that, in other states, government leaders are opening gyms in some counties, but not others. but forestâs wording is broad enough to account for that variation. 
 we rate this claim true."
1669,"wisconsin students, parents and educators shouldered a heavy burden over the past year: a patchwork of in-person, hybrid and virtual schooling as the coronavirus devastated the state.
 last march, gov. tony evers closed k-12 schools in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus. a closure meant to last two weeks ended up lasting till the school yearâs end, and in the fall, only some returned to the classroom full-time.
 reopening decisions have been fraught with controversy. in madison, teachers taught outside school buildings in early march 2021 to protest their districtâs plan to resume in-person learning, arguing it should have been postponed until staff could get vaccinated.
 on the flip side, in early february republicans in the state legislature moved to send $66 million in federal aid to schools already holding in-person classes. ""the bottom line is our kids need to be in school,"" state sen. howard marklein, r-spring green, said at the time.
 evers has said he wants the decision to reopen to be left up to individual school districts because those officials will best understand how much of a threat covid-19 poses in their community, a stance in line with wisconsinâs status as a local-control state.
 appearing on capital city sunday on march 14, 2021, the governor said heâs spoken with many superintendents whoâve successfully managed in-person school since last september.
 that success depends on class sizes, building ventilation and the landscape of local virus transmission â all factors he said would make it difficult to make a statewide judgment on returning to classrooms.
 ""thereâs still a handful of school districts out,"" evers said, but added that heâd like to get students back in school.
 is he correct that just a handful of districts are still learning largely online?
 letâs take a look.
 
 only stateâs two largest school districts remain largely virtual, survey finds
 
 state officials have chosen not to track district reopenings since the end of mandatory closures last june.

 however, a usa today network-wisconsin survey of wisconsinâs regional education agencies found that every district currently has at least some in-person instruction, and only the madison metropolitan school district and milwaukee public schools remain mostly virtual.
 in madison, only the youngest students have returned to school buildings, while students in grades 3 and up are set to return in phases beginning in april. mps offers an in-person option for some students with disabilities and could begin bringing others back starting april 12, 2021.
 wisconsin has 12 cooperative educational service agencies, known as cesas, that help communicate between the stateâs department of public instruction and its 422 school districts. seven cesa administrators surveyed said collectively, there were 150 districts in their jurisdiction where all students can attend school five days a week. thirty-nine districts use a blended model, where students are in school part of the week and learn virtually on other days.
 other cesa administrators said they werenât tracking how many districts were teaching students in-person or blended, but did say all districts were back to some in-person learning.
 while some students have been back in the classroom since september, more moved to come back after winter break. such was the case for the appleton area school district, for example, the sixth-largest in the state.
 school districts generally have virtual options for students and families who did not feel safe returning to the school building, the survey found.
 david honish, agency administrator of cesa 8 in northeastern wisconsin, told a reporter that ""you have people almost making the assumption"" that districts arenât back face-to-face, even when that isnât the case.
 while many districts in his region began the school year virtually or in a hybrid model, most have returned to in-person learning, honish said, with a few exceptions â including one high school that went virtual for two weeks after a covid-19 outbreak.
 districts are required to notify their local health department when they learn of at least two confirmed cases of covid-19 in the same building within two weeks. 
 
 our ruling
 
 evers said there were still a handful of districts learning mostly virtually.
 a usa today network-wisconsin survey found only the stateâs two largest school districts were keeping students mostly virtual, although even they have limited in-person options and are planning april returns.

1695,"some africans living in china are being evicted from their homes amid fears of a second wave of the coronavirus in the country where it originated. social media posts about about the matter caught our attention, including this video shared on facebook:
 ""africans living in china now being forced to sleep outside in the cold,"" reads the caption at the top. a narrator in the video states that ""africans have become subject of racial profiling"" as ""chinese nationals blame them for the rising number of ner coronavirus cases in the country.""
 the video, which carries a logo from the savoy show on it and appears to be a news story, was flagged as part of facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (read more about our partnership with facebook.)
 however, in this case, it is accurate. africans in at least one chinese city are facing widespread evictions and discrimination related to covid-19 fears.
 numerous legitimate news reports describe such targeted evictions, stemming from fears of another covid-19 outbreak, in the southern china city of guangzhou. home to many africans, guangzhou has long been one of chinaâs main commercial and trading centers.
 one report cited a case in which a police officer accompanied a landlord on an eviction of an african. black residents in a part of guangzhou known as ""little africa"" are being forced to remain inside their apartments â even if they have not traveled anywhere that would warrant a quarantine â and submit to coronavirus tests, the washington post reported. chinese officials say they are trying to prevent a second wave of the coronavirus, focusing on foreigners, according to al jazeera. president xi jinping urged authorities to carefully watch for imported cases from âother countries, state news agency xinhua reported. but china has denied racism in the effort.
 but the actions are widespread enough, according to the associated press, that african officials are confronting china over racist treatment of africans, including africans being ejected from hotels in the middle of the night.

1702,"when talks to extend emergency coronavirus unemployment relief broke down last month in washington, u.s. sen. cory booker blamed his wealthy colleagues for the impasse. 
 ""iâm a little frustrated that a body dominated by millionaires, iâm not one of them, is going to focus on just a few hundred extra bucks and try to cut that out from under so many millions of american families,"" booker said in an interview with njtv news. 
 we wondered how many members of congressâ upper chamber really are millionaires. 
 net worth data compiled by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics for 2018, the most recent year available, shows that almost two-thirds of u.s. senatorsâ net worth exceeds $1 million. and a few of them are exceptionally wealthy. 
 financial disclosure forms lawmakers fill out donât require exact values, only ranges of values, so the center for responsive politics calculates lawmakersâ net worth by adding their range of assets, subtracting their range of liabilities, and calculating the midpoint of the resulting range. 
 u.s. sen. rick scott, a florida republican, and u.s. sen. mark warner, a virginia democrat, are the bodyâs wealthiest lawmakers. each reported a net worth of more than $200 million dollars, the data show. 
 two other senators reported net worths greater than $100 million â mitt romney, the former presidential candidate and utah republican, and mike braun, an indiana republican. 
 fifty-seven other lawmakers reported net worths of between $1 million and $100 million, including pennsylvania republican pat toomey, who is worth about $2 million, the data show.

 in the past, roll call analyzed lawmaker wealth by focusing on minimum net worth. 
 bookerâs comments came as the federal unemployment benefits congress approved early in the pandemic were set to expire and negotiations over the next relief package stalled. democrats want to keep offering unemployed americans an extra $600 a week. republicans want to see the extra benefits scaled back or eliminated. 
 booker argued that the senateâs millionaires donât support extending the more generous benefits because they donât know what itâs like to need that money for food and rent. but the center for responsive politics data shows that 25 of the senateâs millionaires are democrats who want to continue the expanded support. 
 besides warner, the wealthiest senate democrats are dianne feinstein of california and michael bennett of colorado. 
 so, is booker a millionaire? 
 no. 
 his net worth is $807,503, the data show. he has a checking account, a savings account, a pension, a money market account, and several iras. his staff also provided a copy of the financial disclosure form booker filed with the senate, and it shows the same.

1703,"a federal prosecutor and a state lawmaker from western new york sparred recently over the scale of coronavirus deaths in their state.
 in a may 30 op-ed in the buffalo news, james p. kennedy jr., the u.s. attorney for the western district of new york, urged a quicker reopening of the economy, in part because he said that a failure to do so would cause psychological harm and spur deaths from drug abuse.
 in the op-ed, kennedy said he has seen a ""roughly three-fold increase in the number of drug overdose deaths"" during the pandemic. as the country is struggling economically, he wrote, ""such measures come at a cost that goes well beyond the adverse impact they have had on our economy.""
 this argument drew a response from monica p. wallace, a democratic assemblywoman for the 143rd district of new york. she told the buffalo news that kennedy glossed over the reality that significantly more people died due to the coronavirus in two months than died of overdoses all of last year.
 the buffalo news paraphrased wallaceâs remark this way: ""wallace said kennedy failed to mention that significantly more people died of covid-19 in two months than died of overdoses all of last year or the year before.""
 when we reached her, wallace confirmed that the paraphrase was accurate.
 we found that her assertion is correct.
 how many covid-19 related deaths were there in two months?
 for the number of coronavirus deaths, wallace referred us to a count by the centers for disease control and prevention that found from the beginning of april until the end of may, approximately 96,647 people died in the united states.

 the total number of deaths through mid-june was 103,339, according to the cdc. however, this may be an underestimate due to difficulties in collecting the full data.
 how many people have died of drug overdoses last year and the previous year? 
 for the number of overdoses, wallace referred us to cdc data. 
 the cdcâs most recent full-year data is for 2018. that year, there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths. in 2017, there were 70,237 overdose deaths. 
 so the national figures show that the two-month toll of coronavirus deaths exceeded the year-long number of drug overdose deaths in both 2017 and 2018.
 the same was true for new york state. there were 21,964 coronavirus deaths in new york state between the start of april and the end of may, according to the covid tracking project. that compares to 3,697 drug overdose deaths for all of 2018 in new york state and 3,921 in 2017.
 our ruling
 wallace said that significantly more people died of covid-19 in two months than died of overdoses all of last year or the year before.
 sheâs correct. nationally, more than 96,000 americans died of the coronavirus in april and may 2020, compared to a bit more than 70,000 americans who died of drug overdoses in the higher of the two most recent years, 2017.
 we rate the statement true."
1742,"last weekend, u.s. sen. pat toomey recorded a message about how to stop the spread of the coronavirus and posted it on twitter. his message was simple and direct â start wearing a homemade mask when you leave the house. 
 ""my mask will keep someone else safe and their mask will keep me safe,"" said toomey, a republican from the lehigh valley. ""iâm not suggesting this is any kind of guarantee. it probably doesnât have tremendous value for the person wearing the mask but it probably does significantly reduce the risk that people could inadvertently transmit it.""
 since masks for health care workers are in such short supply, we wondered whether toomeyâs claim is true. 
 for weeks, public health officials advised healthy americans not to wear masks. but on friday, president donald trump announced that the guidance had changed. the centers for disease control and prevention is now urging everyone to wear homemade cloth masks when they leave the house, just as toomey called for a week ago. he was the first member of congress to advocate for the shift. 
 but even as trump announced the new rules, he said he didnât plan to follow them himself. 
 ""itâs voluntary so you donât have to do it,"" trump said at fridayâs daily coronavirus briefing. ""they suggest it for a period of time. i donât think iâm going to be doing it.""
 trump said the guidance shifted because research indicates that people who are infected with the coronavirus but arenât showing any symptoms can still transmit the disease. he also reiterated that wearing homemade masks is not a replacement for other strategies such as social distancing and hand-washing.
 ""we want to make sure everybody understands itâs not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already gone out,"" deborah birx, coordinator of the white house coronavirus task force, said thursday.

 toomey got another thing right. homemade masks are significantly more effective at preventing asymptomatic carriers of the virus from accidentally spreading it than they are at shielding a healthy person from contracting it. and the efficacy of any homemade mask depends on how itâs made. 
 the most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and make a tight seal around the wearerâs face.
 ""given the current crisis, and lacking an alternative, many layers of densely woven fabric would be the most effective, because it allows for lots of voids in the layers where particles can be trapped,"" richard peltier, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at the university of massachusetts-amherst, told us by email. ""the mask needs to seal as tightly as possible to the face to avoid leaks, though this may not be possible with different designs, fabrics, or face shapes. thin or porous fabrics are the least likely to be effective.""
 a study published in october 2010 tested how cloth masks and common fabrics fared when sprayed with aerosols at different speeds. all of the materials performed worse than hospital-grade n95 respirators. but some, such as cotton towels and scarves, were in the range of some surgical masks. the authors cautioned that fabric materials ""show only marginal filtration performance against virus-size particles when sealed around the edges.""
 another study from 2013 found that cotton masks only perform about half as well as surgical masks and ""should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals."" more recent research had similar results.
 so at best, using thick or layered fabric to make a homemade mask could be as effective as using some surgical masks. at worst, it prevents at least some of your respiratory droplets from spreading to others while in public.
 under ideal circumstances, no face masks are intended to be worn for more than one encounter. that guidance also extends to homemade masks.
 ""at the end of the day, these cloth masks should be treated as contaminated materials that you bring in to your home â they need to be laundered in hot soapy water, and youâd need to consider sanitizing in bleach or hydrogen peroxide regularly,"" peltier said.
 our ruling 
 toomeyâs claim that his homemade mask would keep someone else safe and that someone elseâs homemade mask would keep him safe matches the latest guidance from the cdc. we rate this statement true."
1755,"the coronavirus is now a pandemic, so far infecting nearly 120,000 people worldwide and killing more than 4,000. the centers for disease control and prevention have recommended that travelers avoid visiting italy, among several other countries, unless it's absolutely necessary. 
 italy, meanwhile, is taking its own precautions as covid-19 spreads widely there. 
 a recent blog post claims those precautions include putting the entire country ""into quarantine.""
 ""italian prime minister has announced that the entire country goes into quarantine, as part of emergency measures aimed at halting the spread of the coronavirus,"" the undated post says. ""the governmentâs extraordinary measures, announced at palazzo chigi late on 9 march, comes amid a worsening of the coronavirus outbreak. the new stringent measures, covering the entire country, and would take effect tomorrow morning.""
 this post was flagged as part of facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (read more about our partnership with facebook.) 
 but this post is essentially true: on march 9, italian prime minister declared all of italy a ""red zone,"" which means people should stay home except for work and emergencies, according to npr. the emergency quarantine measure had already been in place in northern italy, where most of the covid-19 cases are.

 italians must now also seek permission for essential travel, according to the bbc â and permission will only be granted for people with valid work or family reasons that canât be postponed. people are forbidden from gathering in public and all sporting events are suspended. schools and universities are closed until april 3. 
 there are other rules that indicate the nation is allowing some movement, however restricted, including a 6 p.m. curfew on bars and restaurants, a ban on jail visits, and an embargo on unnecessary shopping. shopping centers, except for pharmacies and food markets, must close on weekends, according to abc news. people are being asked to stand at least a meter apart from one another in supermarket lines.
 but as the new york times reports, the exact restrictions of the quarantine arenât clear to some italians. 
 ""we are hearing too many things and people donât really get whatâs going on,"" the newspaper quoted one woman as saying. she said she thought it was fine to take a walk around milan, where she lives, but said the governmentâs explanations ""arenât clear at all.""
 itâs worth noting that the word ""quarantine"" also has several definitions. according to merriam webster, it can mean ""a state of forced isolation."" clearly not everyone in the country is being forced into isolation. but it can also mean ""a restraint upon the activities or communication of persons or transport of goods designed to prevent the spread of disease or pests,"" a definition that fits what we are seeing in italy. the countryâs lockdown also seems well within the definition of quarantine used by the u.s. department of health and human services: ""to separate and restrict the movement of well persons who may have been exposed to a communicable disease to see if they become ill.""

1785,"authorities are trying to figure how they can hold elections while preventing voters from infecting each other with coronavirus.
 one idea? expand the practice of absentee voting.
 in north carolina, top republicans have said they want to keep the stateâs current absentee voting laws. a pair of democrats -- jay chaudhuri of wake county and natasha marcus of mecklenburg -- have described north carolinaâs absentee rules as antiquated.
 ""north carolina is in the small minority of states that requires an absentee ballot to be signed by two witnesses or a notary public,"" they wrote in an april 10 op-ed on medium.com.
 is it true that nc is in a ""minority"" of states that requires two people to witness an absentee ballot? yes.
 verifying absentee ballots
 a breakdown of absentee rules is available via the national conference of state legislatures, a nonpartisan group that tracks various laws in each state.
 in most states -- 31 according to the ncsl -- elections boards simply compare the voterâs signature on an absentee ballot with a signature they already have on file for the voter. if thereâs a discrepancy, election officials investigate.

 north carolina is one of eight states that requires a witness to sign a voterâs absentee ballot, and one of only three states that requires the ballot to be signed by two witnesses if a notary isnât available. the other states are alabama and rhode island.
 the information on the ncsl website was confirmed as accurate by conference spokeswoman wendy underhill.
 that doesnât necessarily mean that north carolina is the hardest state to return an absentee ballot.
 alabama, in addition to requiring signatures from two witnesses or a notary, requires voters to submit a copy of a voter id with his ballot.
 in mississippi, missouri and oklahoma, you canât have just any witness. the ballots are required to be signed by a notary.
 rules for who qualifies for an absentee ballot vary by state, too. 
 our ruling
 state senators marcus and chaudhuri said ""north carolina is in the small minority of states that requires an absentee ballot to be signed by two witnesses or a notary public.""
 according to a nonpartisan organization that tracks state laws, nc is one of only three states (6 percent of the us) that requires absentee ballots to be signed by two witnesses or a notary public. we rate this statement true."
1792,"president biden signed into law the american rescue plan act of 2021, or the arp for short, on march 11 after a party-line vote in the u.s. senate and with no republican support to go along with two ""no"" democrat votes in the u.s. house. the act provides u.s. citizens with financial support during the covid-19 pandemic. 
 many people are familiar with the third round of stimulus checks that came from the legislation, but the arp includes additional provisions for economic relief, including emergency funding for states, homeowner assistance, and small business credit.
 given the actâs partisan vote, we noted that one of the iowa democratic partyâs leaders, state senate minority leader zach wahls, promoted the act when writing in one of his weekly newsletters:
 ""the federal american rescue plan will purchase more food from farmers for distribution through food banks, nonprofits and restaurants, helping to feed families in need and support farmersâ bottom lines.""
 in an email exchange with the daily iowan, wahls referenced a march 10 u.s. department of agriculture fact sheet as the primary source for his claim, which matched his newsletter almost word for word. but, does that mean more is being spent on farmers? 
 the answer is yes, although allocated money in this program also goes to non-farmers.
 u.s. department of agriculture performance manager chris nelson said in a phone interview with the di that $4 billion is being added to the usdaâs budget for spending in 2021 and in upcoming years. subsection a of the arpâs section 1001 states that $4 billion will be appropriated to the usda to fund the legislationâs agriculture relief effort.

 however, nelson said the usda still must determine where, specifically, to spend the $4 billion.
 nelson said the usda annually releases a budget report for the following year. he said the budget for fiscal 2022, which normally would have been published two months ago, was delayed because of the presidential transition and wonât be published until may or june.
 the usdaâs budget summary for fiscal 2021, published in february 2020 does not include arpâs $4 billion.
 as for the legislationâs agriculture relief effort, the $4 billion is to be used to purchase fresh food and distribute it to nonprofits, food banks, and restaurants, according to section 1001. the same section also states the $4 billion is to finance loans and grants for food processors, distributors, and producers as additional aid in response to the pandemic.
 andrew wheeler, the media contact for the iowa farm bureau, said efforts to buy fresh produce directly from farmers tend to happen over a prolonged period of time because of the need to wait until after the growing season occurs.
 our ruling
 how the american rescue plan is to be spent still is to be determined. but, while the act doesnât specifically call out farmers by name, it explicitly orders a new $4 billion usda appropriation to buy fresh food for nonprofits, food banks, and restaurants, plus additional relief for non-farmers in the food supply chain.

1822,"when president donald trump threatened to reject the coronavirus economic relief package passed with wide bipartisan support, u.s. sen. pat toomey appeared on fox news to defend the plan and stress how urgently businesses need relief. 
 ""in my state, as in many other states, we have governors who are closing down businesses again,"" toomey, a republican from pennsylvania, said sunday before trump relented and signed the measure into law. 
 we wondered how sweeping the latest round of virus shutdowns is and what types of establishments are affected. 
 earlier this month, pennsylvania gov. tom wolf halted indoor dining, closed casinos, gyms, and entertainment venues, and lowered retail occupancy limits statewide for the first time since the spring. the new restrictions came as the state started reporting more than 10,000 new infections per day. 
 wolf said he hoped the restrictions would slow the spread of the virus and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed just before vaccines become widely available. 
 ""this is a bridge to a better future in pennsylvania,"" wolf said. 
 before this latest round of closures, all 67 pennsylvania counties had been in the ""green"" phase of the wolf administrationâs three-step reopening plan since july 3, even though trump falsely claimed otherwise on the campaign trail. that allowed many businesses to operate at 75% capacity. 
 since the new rules took effect on dec. 11, the number of new cases reported each day in pennsylvania fell to as low as 4,621 on dec. 27, and the seven-day average fell to 7,757.

 the restrictions are set to expire on jan. 4, but pennsylvania health secretary rachel levine said the state may extend them if cases climb again in the days ahead. a local ban on indoor dining in philadelphia will remain in effect until jan. 15.
 soon after wolf announced this latest round of restrictions, at least a dozen gym and restaurant owners across pennsylvania publicly vowed to defy them. 
 business owners argued they should be allowed to stay open because internal data they collected showed their establishments hadnât been the source of any community spread. a recent stanford university study, however, linked restaurants, gyms, and crowded indoor spaces to 80% of infections in 10 u.s. cities in the early months of the pandemic. 
 ""if i have to prove my point by being taken out in handcuffs, then so be it,"" said phil guarno, who owns fenicciâs italian restaurant in hershey, pa., which has remained open for indoor dining despite the new order. ""itâs gotten to the point where itâs really do or die. itâs time to stand up against this tyranny.""
 the relief bill includes a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses like guarnoâs, as well as temporary $300 per week supplemental jobless benefits for the unemployed and $600 direct payments to most americans. schools, healthcare providers, and renters facing eviction will also get relief. 
 across the country, at least seven other states and the district of columbia have joined pennsylvania and imposed restrictions on large numbers of businesses. they include illinois, minnesota, washington, oregon, california, arizona, and new mexico. ten states have halted activity at some businesses, and elsewhere, establishments remain largely open even as the pandemic rages on.
 our ruling 
 toomey said ""in my state, as in many other states, we have governors who are closing down businesses again."" 
 heâs right that pennsylvania shuttered many businesses earlier this month, and seven other states have imposed similarly sweeping restrictions. we rate toomeyâs statement true."

 ""if students donât have access to internet they can call 1.844.488.8398 during the school shutdown for free internet from spectrum,"" the march 13 post says.

1853,"the stalemate between a democratic governor and a republican-dominated legislature has left wisconsin without a clear path forward to address the coronavirus pandemic.
 gov. tony evers has declared multiple states of emergency to implement a stay-at-home order and mask mandates. republicans â who have a stranglehold on both legislative houses â have challenged those in court, once successfully.
 but they have chosen not to overturn eversâ orders themselves, despite having the authority to do so.
 one viral facebook post goes a step farther to say republican legislators havenât done anything at all of late.
 ""wisconsin republicans have not passed a single bill in 6 months,"" says the oct. 4, 2020, post, which is a screenshot of a tweet from the day before.
 this post was flagged as part of facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (read more about our partnership with facebook).
 the post goes on to criticize republicans for pushing back against evers, saying they havenât ""done a single thing"" to slow the spread of covid. (thatâs not accurate, as republicans did pass a covid-19 relief bill early in the pandemic.)
 but letâs focus in on the timeframe claim. 
 amid a global pandemic that has fundamentally changed society throughout 2020, has the legislature really not passed a single bill in half a year?
 the last bill
 the most recent law passed through the state legislature came in april. the assembly passed a covid-19 response bill on april 14, and the senate passed it a day later. the wide-ranging bill addressed unemployment, health care, education and government procedures in the wake of the pandemic, many provisions of which applied only during the first public health emergency that was declared by evers in march.
 that was more than five and a half months before this facebook post. so the reference to six months is pretty much correct.
 the legislature has taken up no legislation since then. the only other action came aug. 31, when legislative leaders held a pro-forma special session for a less than a minute without addressing police use-of-force legislation that evers urged them to take up.
 the context
 but letâs take a little wider view before we rule on this claim.

 the legislature is a cyclical body, and a lengthy period of inaction this time of year is actually normal. the legislature typically adjourns in spring of an election year and doesnât come back until the new calendar year, and the 2020 calendar approved for this year back in january 2019 was no different.
 of course, this year is anything but normal.
 so a better gauge may be how other state legislatures have responded to the coronavirus.
 and wisconsin lawmakers have been among the least active in the country, according to a database of all covid-related legislation across the country maintained by the national conference of state legislatures.
 the bill passed in mid-april is the lone piece of coronavirus legislation adopted or enacted here, as nine other proposals failed. only three states have done less, as north dakota, texas and montana have passed no bills. indiana has also passed one.
 nationally, 810 covid bills have been adopted or enacted by state legislatures, led by 71 in louisiana, 51 in california and 50 in new jersey.
 in many respects, it would be fair to hold wisconsin to a higher standard of action, since it has a full-time legislature. the national conference says wisconsin is one of 10 states it considers full-time, meaning legislators work 80% or more of a full-time job, have large staffs and are paid enough to make a living without needing outside income.
 a wispolitics.com analysis found wisconsin has done far less than the other nine during the pandemic.
 the assembly and senate have met just twice since the pandemic began â for each house to pass the april covid bill. the other states have met an average of 38 times, with only illinois (nine meetings) coming in at less than 20.
 itâs important to note, however, that seven of the nine other full-time legislatures are in states with an annual budget (as opposed to wisconsinâs biennial budget), meaning they need more floor sessions to pass that each year.
 kit beyer, a spokeswoman for assembly speaker robin vos, r-rochester, noted that while the legislature has not been in session, legislators have other work as well. in the past six months she said legislators have worked to help constituents with issues like getting unemployment benefits and have continued to meet in committees to prepare future legislation.
 our ruling
 a viral facebook post says, ""wisconsin republicans have not passed a single bill in 6 months,"" criticizing a lack of legislative action amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 the timeframe is largely accurate. itâs been more than five and a half months since the legislature passed any bill.
 itâs not unusual in an election year for the legislature to adjourn from spring until the new year. but the wisconsin legislatureâs inaction is unusual for this year, as lawmakers have done less than almost any other state to address the pandemic despite being one of just 10 full-time legislatures in the nation.
 that makes this a reasonable statement.
 we rate this claim true."
1889,"del. kirk cox has been leading republican criticism that virginia is off to a slow start in getting covid-19 vaccines into the arms of citizens.
 cox laid the blame on outgoing democratic gov. ralph northam on jan. 13 during the gop response to northamâs state of the commonwealth speech.
 ""the northam administrationâs ability to distribute and administer vaccines has been extremely disappointing,"" cox said. ""ranking in the bottom third of states nationally, every state we border is doing a better job than virginia in administering this life-saving vaccine.""
 cox, from colonial heights, is a former speaker of the house who is seeking the republican gubernatorial nomination this year, and his criticism is likely to become a campaign issue. so we fact checked his claim about virginiaâs bottom-third ranking and found that he was being charitable in describing the roll out.
 the day cox made his statement, virginia ranked 39th among states in getting its allotted vaccine doses into peopleâs arms, according to beckerâs hospital review, a health systems website that, among many other things, analyzes data from the centers for disease control and prevention.
 since then, virginiaâs ranking has fallen. on jan. 19, the latest date of cdc data available at this writing, virginia ranked 48th. from the 853,000 vaccines distributed to the state, 327,000 shots were given - a 38.3% rate.
 the national rate was 50.4%. the two states trailing virginia were georgia and alabama. north dakota had the highest rate, using 82% of its allotted vaccines for shots.

 northamâs response
 at a jan. 14 news conference, northam said he was satisfied with the vaccine rollout. ""this is probably one of the most massive logistical efforts that has ever taken place in virginia, when you think about it, to get 8.5 million virginians not one dose, but two doses,"" he said. ""iâm pleased with the way weâve rolled.""
 administration officials have said published virginia data is undercounted because of delays and glitches in the stateâs electronic reporting system. during the seven-day period ending on jan. 19, virginia averaged giving 17,464 shots a day, according to the state department of healthâs dashboard. northam said he wants to reach 50,000 shots a day and have all virginians double vaccinated by early to mid summer.
 northam took steps last week to speed things up. he announced that all people 65 and older would now be eligible for the vaccine, and so would people aged 16 to 64 with health problems. northam said that makes about half of virginians eligible for vaccines. the rest will qualify later. 
 our ruling 
 cox said on jan.13 that virginia ranked ""in the bottom third of states nationally"" in getting its allotted covid-19 vaccines into arms. virginia ranked 39th in the nation on that date. although not part of this ruling, it should be noted that virginia has since fallen to 48th, even though it has picked up pace in giving vaccines.

1952,"in the earliest days of the coronavirus outbreak, when public officials scrambled to close schools and businesses, a facebook user lamented the inequity of the quarantine that gov. tom wolf had imposed on pennsylvanians.
 ""the poor are, ironically, the most likely to be employed in the industries deemed âessentialâ while their upper-class peers are freed to bunker down for weeks until the first death wave passes,"" the facebook user wrote on march 18.
 we wondered whether this claim would hold up when we looked at the data.
 starting with wolfâs executive order forcing all non-life-sustaining businesses to close, we pulled u.s. bureau of labor statistics information on the number of pennsylvania workers in each essential industry and calculated their average annual wages.
 the facebook user is right. the vast majority of life-sustaining workers earn low and working-class wages.
 a quarter of pennsylvaniaâs essential workers make less than $30,000 annually, and two-thirds make less than the stateâs household median of $60,000, raising questions about whether the people keeping the rest of society afloat are being sufficiently protected and compensated.
 grocery stores employ one of the largest groups of workers making the lowest wages. there are more than 120,000 grocery store workers in pennsylvania, the data shows, and average annual wages for the sector are about $23,000. gas stations, assisted living centers and building maintenance firms are among the other essential businesses employing large numbers of low-wage workers across the state.
 philadelphia-area grocers including giant, acme and aldi recently started limiting the number of shoppers allowed in their stores at once to protect workers.
 still, across the country, dozens of grocery clerks have already been sickened with the virus. and a trader joeâs worker in scarsdale, n.y., a greeter at a giant store in largo, md., and two walmart employees from the same chicago-area store have died from the coronavirus in recent days.
 acknowledging how vulnerable essential workers are, wolf recently announced new rules aimed at preventing the virus from spreading in businesses open to in-person customers. grocery stores must now make all workers and customers wear masks and start taking employeesâ temperatures if a worker tests positive.

 but even as the state rolled out these new protections, it hasnât done any more to ensure that the workers wolf deemed essential are fairly compensated besides asking employers to step up and do the right thing. wolf called fair pay for essential workers ""the responsibility of the private sector.""
 among the grocers that operate in the philadelphia area, several chains, including trader joeâs, whole foods, wegmans, fresh grocer, giant eagle and acme have started offering workers bonuses or higher hourly wages to their workers because of the coronavirus outbreak.
 the second part of the facebook post addresses the perk the user believes white collar workers have enjoyed since wolf ordered millions of pennsylvanians to stay at home â the freedom to work from home.
 federal data from a bureau of labor statistics survey on the share of workers who say theyâre able to telecommute shows a stark divide among industries, the washington post reported
 about 60 percent of people who said they work in ""management, business and financial operations"" said they can work from home. but fewer than 10 percent of workers said they could do so in categories such as ""services,"" ""construction and extraction,"" ""installation, maintenance and repair,"" ""production"" and ""transportation and material moving.""
 the post also found divisions along race and class lines.
 thirty-seven percent of asian americans and 30 percent of whites said they could work remotely. but only 20 percent of african americans and 16 percent of hispanics said they had that ability. almost 52 percent of those with a college education or higher said they could work from home, but only 4 percent of those with less than a high school diploma said they could.

 the facebook post stated that the poor are the most likely to be employed in essential industries while workers who earn more are free to shelter at home until the outbreak subsides.
 our data analysis shows that the vast majority of workers wolf deemed essential earn low and working class wages, and a recent analysis by the washington post shows that many white collar workers say theyâre able to telecommute. for these reasons, we rate the facebook post true.

2000,"roy cooper and dan forest agree that north carolinaâs coronavirus response stands out among southern states.
 but the gubernatorial candidates disagree over whether thatâs a good thing.
 democratic gov. cooper and republican lt. gov. forest squared off on wednesday night for north carolinaâs only gubernatorial debate of the year. at one point in the debate, forest praised north carolinaâs border states for allowing many businesses to reopen while their respective governments addressed the coronavirus outbreak.
 ""this covid science is an interesting thing because you cross the border into south carolina and south carolinaâs open and people are out there going to restaurants and doing things,"" forest said. ""you cross into tennessee and tennessee is open, you cross into georgia and georgia is open. theyâre learning how to live with the virus and protect the vulnerable and get people back to work.""
 cooper immediately offered a comparison between north carolina and georgia.
 ""itâs interesting that dan mentions georgia â¦ he wants to be like georgia,"" cooper said. ""georgia is about the same size as north carolina, yet they have almost 100,000 more cases, almost twice as many deaths and almost 600 more nursing home deaths than north carolina.""
 cooper is right about the sizes of north carolina and georgia. georgia is the eighth most populous state in the u.s. and north carolina is the ninth most populous, according to 2019 census data. the states are separated by fewer than 130,000 people.
 so what about those stats cooper mentioned?
 cooper spokeswoman liz doherty referred us to a coronavirus tracker on the new york times website and nursing home data on the centers for medicare and medicaid services website. politifact north carolina also looked at information on the north carolina and georgia state websites.
 case counts vary a little bit, depending on the source. but otherwise, cooper is mostly spot-on.
 comparing cases
 cooper said georgia has almost 100,000 more cases than north carolina. on the night of the debate, data from each stateâs health department showed georgia with about 98,100 more cases. so cooperâs not far off. 
 north carolinaâs health department reported 236,407 confirmed cases and georgiaâs health department reported 334,601 cases.

 the new york times map showed 236,810 cases for north carolina and 319,609 total cases for georgia, for a difference of about 82,800.
 cooper didnât compare each stateâs infection numbers to its population. but that statistic provides useful context.
 the night of the debate, the new york timesâ reported that north carolina had 2,258 cases per 100,000 residents and georgia had 3,010 cases per 100,000 residents.
 comparing deaths
 cooper said georgia had ""almost twice as many deaths"" as north carolina. this claim is on track too.
 on the night of the debate, north carolinaâs health department reported 3,856 total deaths. twice that many would be 7,712 deaths. georgiaâs health department reported 7,470 total deaths. 
 the times, meanwhile, reported 3,882 total deaths in north carolina (a rate of 37 deaths per 100,000 residents) and 7,298 total deaths in georgia (meaning 69 deaths per 100,000 people.)
 so if you look at total deaths, the times and the nc health department both show there have been about 3,800. georgia is 200 to 400 deaths away from having twice as many. 
 nursing homes
 finally, letâs look at nursing homes.
 cooper said georgia has had almost 600 more nursing home deaths than north carolina. on debate night, data tracked by the federal government showed georgia having 569 more nursing home deaths than north carolina.
 cms reported 1,328 nursing home deaths in north carolina and 1,897 in georgia.
 cooper didnât mention nursing home cases. to round out the full picture, weâll report them anyway.
 on the night of the debate, cms reported 6,523 total nursing home cases in north carolina and 9,483 total cases in georgia.
 our ruling
 cooper said georgia has ""almost 100,000 more cases, almost twice as many deaths and almost 600 more nursing home deaths than north carolina.""
 his claim about cases requires the most rounding, but isnât far off. but his claim about deaths â in total and in nursing homes â are spot-on. we rate this claim true."
2016,"sen. marco rubio, r. fla., claimed that president joe biden talks like a centrist, but is ""governing like someone from the far-left.""
 ""he has issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than obama, more than trump, more than anyone,"" rubio said in a video.
 is that true?
 rubio tweeted the video shortly before 8 a.m. jan. 22, so we evaluated rubioâs claim based on actions biden had taken up to that point (jan. 20-21).
 setting aside the political implications of the word ""fiat,"" we found that available evidence supports rubioâs assessment: bidenâs use of the executive power in his first two days far outpaced that of his predecessors.
 rubioâs office did not respond to our requests for information.
 
 
 
 available evidence backs rubioâs claim
 the total number of presidential directives signed by biden during his first two days in office is greater than the number signed by presidents donald trump and barack obama over the same period.
 biden issued 17 executive orders on his first two days in office, compared with trump who issued one and obama who issued two. biden issued three proclamations, while trump and obama each issued one.
 executive orders state how to manage the operations of the executive branch of the federal government. proclamations communicate information on holidays, commemorations, special observances, trade, and policy.
 the office of the federal register numbers each executive order and proclamation consecutively as part of a series and publishes them in the daily federal register after the white house sends over the information. other presidential documents, such as memoranda and notices, are not numbered but are also published.
 the office of the federal register is in the process of digitizing documents published prior to 1994. so we were unable to use that source to compare bidenâs actions with all other presidents. we turned instead to the american presidency project, a nonpartisan source of presidential documents hosted at the university of california, santa barbara.
 if rubio was referring to a presidentâs first two days in office (instead of any two-day period), the available documents show that he is correct dating back to president franklin d. roosevelt, whose first inauguration was in 1933, said gerhard peters, a political science professor at citrus college and co-director of the american presidency project.
 the available record before fdr isnât complete enough to say definitively whether rubio is also right about earlier presidents, but experts said itâs likely that his claim still holds.
 ""before fdr, presidents simply did not charge into office as prepared for action,"" said john woolley, co-director of american presidency project and professor emeritus of political science at ucsb. ""even lincoln, judging by the record assembled by (his secretaries john g. nicolay and john hay), did not fire off as many orders as biden despite there already being an active revolt in progress.""
 many of bidenâs executive orders target the pandemic
 rubio used the word ""fiat"" â a politicized term that would suggest biden rushed in sweeping and long-lasting policy changes. however, biden in his first two days issued 10 executive orders and one memorandum to address a specific issue thatâs actively affecting the entire nation: the coronavirus pandemic. biden was sworn into office around the time the united states recorded about 400,000 deaths from covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
 hereâs a rundown of those specific actions:

 executive order to protect workers from covid-19 under the occupational safety and health act

 ""no one would doubt the need for executive action to deal with an overwhelming health crisis, so this crisis situation makes this a unique point in time,"" said john frendreis, a professor emeritus of political science at loyola university chicago. ""rubioâs comment is technically correct, although when taken together with the context, it is exaggerated.""
 besides those covid-19 measures, bidenâs actions included an order requiring an ethics pledge from his appointees and directives revoking several of trumpâs policies.
 itâs become more common for presidents to issue executive actions and for the other party to dislike it, said daniel gitterman, a public policy professor at the university of north carolina at chapel hill.
 ""when itâs the president of the opposite party, they call it executive fiat, and when itâs the president of the same party, they call it bold action,"" gitterman said.
 according to the federal register, trump signed 220 executive orders during his four years in office. throughout their eight-year administrations, obama signed 276 executive orders and george w. bush signed 291.
 our ruling
 rubio said biden ""has issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than obama, more than trump, more than anyone.""
 fiats"" is a politically loaded term and ignores that many of bidenâs directives were specific to the ongoing pandemic.
 still, the available evidence on the number of directives issued supports rubioâs claim.
 we rate it true.

2024,"the novel coronavirus reached the nba this week, with utah jazz center rudy gobert testing positive in oklahoma city moments before the jazz were set to tip off against the thunder.
 the development led the nba to suspend its season. the jazz said in a statement that after diagnostic tests were administered to team players, staff and traveling beat reporters, only one of the reported 58 people tested in connection with gobert â guard donovan mitchell, who confirmed his positive test on instagram â was found to be carrying covid-19.
 the jazzâs quick access to 58 coronavirus tests seemed at odds with the fact that the united states has lagged behind other countries where testing has been more widespread. 
 ""some states are only getting 50 tests per day, and the utah jazz got 58?"" said michael dougherty, a senior writer for the national review, in a march 12 tweet.
 some states are only getting 50 tests per day, and the utah jazz got 58? 
 
 if tests are going to remain scarce, how they're distributed will be a subject not just of controversy, but of fury and reprisal. https://t.co/eip3nnooxrâ michael brendan dougherty (@michaelbd) march 12, 2020 
 we wondered how the jazz team personnel got their hands on covid-19 tests in a matter of hours, and what kind of access states have had to testing by comparison.
 we found that doughertyâs claim lined up with the information thatâs available, despite some murkiness around the number of tests that have been conducted across the country.
 how the jazz got tests so quickly
 after a sprinting medical staffer alerted referees to gobertâs confirmed infection minutes before the game was supposed to start, the state of oklahoma quickly completed tests for 58 people close to the organization who had come in contact with gobert. 
 
 the results for those 58 people came back within nine to 10 hours, said andy larsen, a jazz beat writer for the salt lake tribune who was tested for having been in recent contact with gobert.
 the process was fast, with medical professionals taking throat and sinus swabs from the team personnel at the arena, larsen said. ""it really only does take like two minutes,"" he said.
 the specimens were then shipped to oklahomaâs public health lab, where they were tested overnight using test kits provided by the centers for disease control and prevention, said jaime dukes, a spokesperson for the oklahoma state department of health.
 dukes told us the oklahoma lab has been running tests since march 6, and that the lab has completed roughly 150 tests since then, including the tests on the jazz personnel. 
 that means many of the tests in oklahoma were completed in one night. dukes said thatâs because oklahoma has been following the cdcâs case-definition requirements, which currently say that clinicians should use judgment to decide if a symptomatic patient should be tested.
 clinicians are supposed to prioritize people with serious symptoms, people who are older or have underlying medical conditions, and people who had close contact with a confirmed or suspected coronavirus patient or recently traveled to an affected area, according to the cdc.
 ""that honestly was the first incident weâve had where 58 people at one time needed to be tested,"" dukes said. ""weâve been meeting the demand, but we are being very clear about our criteria for testing.""
 nba spokesman tim frank said oklahoma health officials directed the jazz testing without intervention from the nba, and that there was ""nothing we did to accelerate it.""
 but state epidemiologist laurence burnsed, speaking at a march 12 press conference, said the nba has ""policies in place"" that helped gobert get tested quickly. nba team trainers regularly monitor players for illness and work with local physicians when needed, burnsed said.
 according to the associated press, a number of other nba franchises are having employees self-quarantine or get tested after coming into contact with gobert and mitchell in recent weeks.

 how many tests are being conducted per state?
 itâs hard to precisely say how many tests the u.s. has administered, in part because the cdc has outsourced some responsibility to states as well as private, academic and commercial labs. thereâs no centralized database tracking everything.
 testing in the u.s. was slowed from the get-go by flaws with the governmentâs early test kits and barriers that have been relaxed but still limit who can get tested. 
 stephen hahn, commissioner of the food and drug administration, said march 7 that public health labs have the ability to test a total of 75,000 people. 
 he also said 1.1 million tests had been shipped to private labs, with another roughly 1 million on the way and still more to come from other academic and commercial labs.
 the u.s. took another step toward increasing its capabilities on march 13 when it gave over $1 million to two companies to develop new, one-hour tests.
 itâs not clear that those capabilities are being met, however. 
 according to a tracker from the american enterprise institute, the different labs running tests throughout the u.s. should have been capable of cumulatively testing more than 25,000 per day, at least as of march 13. (dougherty is also a visiting fellow at aei.)

 plus, the number of tests isnât the same as the number of people who have been tested. not everyone seeking a coronavirus test can get one. even sick people have been denied.
 as of march 12, the cdcâs website said it had tested roughly 3,903 specimens in cdc labs, plus about 9,721 in public health labs across the u.s.âs various states. 
 those numbers, while incomplete, pale in comparison with countries like south korea, which ramped up testing weeks ago by setting up drive-thru screening clinics.
 ""widespread testing was a key component of china and south korea's response strategy,"" said caitlin rivers, an epidemiologist at the johns hopkins center for health security. ""both countries have made significant progress in controlling their outbreaks.""
 the u.s. pace has been more sluggish. dougherty told us his claim could be traced to early march reports from the atlantic and buzzfeed news, which said public health labs in states such as hawaii and arkansas were capable at the time of running fewer than 50 tests per day.
 dougherty also cited a recent report from yahoo news, which relied on state and federal data from the covid tracking project, a project of the atlantic run by reporters and data scientists. 
 the project tracks the numbers presented on state government websites to provide a more accurate overall testing count. (while the cdc website highlights the number of specimens tested, the covid tracking project tracks the number of people.)
 the yahoo news article noted that the covid tracking project counted 2,728 people tested by states and the district of columbia on march 10, for an average of less than 55 per state. some states tested fewer than 50 that day, according to the projectâs tally. the project reported that 2,219 people were tested by states on march 11, or roughly 43 people per state.
 our daily 4pm et update is out. the topline number is not good: ~10000 people tested, according to our state-level data, which cannot track all negative tests. that's a smaller day-over-day increase than yesterday.

2549,"twitter has apologised for going into overdrive in labelling certain tweets that actually did not violate its policies around 5g and covid-19, saying it would soon fix the issue. the micro-blogging platform said it is now working on to improve its algorithms how it labels tweets with problematic 5g or coronavirus content after several users reported their unrelated tweets are being flagged with a 5g and coronavirus fact-check label.
 
 ""in the last few weeks, you may have seen tweets with labels linking to additional info about covid-19. not all of those tweets had potentially misleading content associating covid-19 and 5g,"" the twitter support team tweeted on saturday.
 
 ""we apologise for any confusion and we're working to improve our labelling process"". twitter began fact-checking tweets that linked 5g and coronavirus earlier this month, by adding the label that reads ""get the facts about covid-19 with ""no, 5g isn't causing coronavirus"" as its title.
 
  
  
  
 
 
 twitter said: ""as we improve this process to be more precise, our goal is to show fewer labels on unrelated tweets"". with some accounts spreading false information about the fifth-generation cellular network (5g), linking the technology with coronavirus, twitter in april took a decision to take down such messages inciting harmful activities.
 
 the move was part of twitter's effort to provide people with reliable information, connect with others, and follow what is happening in real-time amid the coronavirus pandemic. while conspiracy theories surrounding 5g started surfacing much before covid-19 hit the world, the pandemic only increased their spread with some messages even blaming 5g for the disease.
 
 ""we have broadened our guidance on unverified claims that incite people to engage in a harmful activity, could lead to the destruction or damage of critical 5g infrastructure or could lead to widespread panic, social unrest, or large-scale disorder,"" twitter had said.

2553,"a death review committee set up by brihanmumbai municipal corporation (bmc) will assess the cause of death of the 68-year-old philippines national who passed away in a private hospital in mumbai on sunday night. the man was initially admitted to the bmc-run kasturba hospital. days before his death, he had tested negative for sars-cov-2, the virus from the coronavirus family that causes covid-19.
 the bmc committee will assess whether he died of covid-19, or renal failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards).
 
 what is the history of this case?https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
 the man was part of a group of nine philippines nationals who arrived in mumbai on march 3. he then took a train to new delhi, and returned to mumbai on march 10. on march 12 afternoon, he developed symptoms of flu, and was taken to a local doctor. on march 13, he tested positive for covid-19, and was admitted to kasturba hospital.
 with co-morbidities like diabetes and asthma, his condition remained critical, and he was put on ventilator support. in between, he developed kidney complications, and was taken to the bmcâs b y l nair hospital for dialysis. he was tested in accordance with protocol and, a few days ago, his nasopharyngeal swab (swab taken from the back of the nose and throat) tested negative for the novel coronavirus.
 the man was then discharged, and was shifted to a private superspecialty hospital for treatment of his kidneys. this is where he died. dr daksha shah, bmcâs deputy executive health officer, said that since the man had tested negative, his death is so far not being considered a covid-19 death.
 why must the case be studied further?
 the key question is: is a nasal or throat swab sufficient to rule out the virus? that is, can a person have the virus in their body even if their respiratory samples test negative?
 a new study in the lancet gastroenterology and hepatology shows that the novel coronavirus can remain in the faeces of patients for five weeks after their respiratory samples test negative. (âprolonged presence of sars-cov-2 viral rna in faecal samplesâ, yongjian wu et al.: published march 19, the researchers analysed respiratory and faecal matter of 74 covid-19 patients from january 16 to march 15 at the fifth affiliated hospital of sun yat-sen university in zhuhai, china. in 55% of cases (41 of 74 patients), the respiratory samples (throat swabs) tested positive for coronavirus for 16.7 days, and faecal matter tested positive for 27.9 days after the first onset of symptoms, the study found.
 the implication is this: even if a confirmed case returns negative for the novel coronavirus in a nasal swab test, the virus may still be in body.
 that there is a possibility that he may have still had the virus in his body fluids, even though his respiratory samples tested negative. given his age, asthma, diabetes, and later renal complications, the virus added to the problem and worsened his condition.
 the lancet study found that the virus rna was âactively replicating in the patientsâ gastrointestinal tractâ even after clearance from their respiratory tract. it also said that there is a possibility of viral shedding for nearly five weeks in the faeces of infected person. the virus could remain in the environment for days, and could be transmitted by the faecal-oral transmission mode, although this is yet to been detected in a covid-19 case.
 similar transmission patterns were observed during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) outbreaks, both of which were caused by pathogens of the coronavirus family. dr om srivastava, an infectious diseases expert who is a member of the death review committee, said: âfurther tests are needed to check viral load in saliva, tears, semen as well. zika virus remained in semen for nine months.â
 blood, urine, and stool samples of confirmed covid-19 patients at kasturba hospital are being sent every day to the national institute of virology in pune for analysis of viral shedding.
 what will the bmcâs panel do now?
 a member of the committee said that stool, urine, and blood samples of the philippines national will be analysed to test for the presence of the virus, and whether viral shedding continued after he was discharged from kasturba hospital. the committee comprises infectious disease experts, intensive medicine doctors, and civic health officials.
 bmc has earlier taken a similar approach in deaths caused by dengue and h1n1 infection as well. in deaths of patients with several co-morbidities, a review of the medical condition is done to understand whether the infection was the direct or indirect cause of death.

 the first covid-19 death in maharashtra, a 64-year-old who had travelled to dubai, too had tested negative for coronavirus a day before his death. he was still considered a covid-19 death because he passed away before a second confirmatory test for the virus could be carried out. as per government guidelines, two tests must be conducted within 24 hours to rule out the presence of the virus in an infected person.
 in the case of the 68-year-old filipino, both these tests were carried out before the presence of the virus was ruled out.

  according to a news report by ndtv, both these tests are to begin soon. editor's note: this article, which was originally published at 2.15 pm on june 1, 2021, was updated hours later to include the statement of dr vk paul, member (health) in niti aayog and chair of the national expert group on vaccine administration for covid-19. during the day's press briefing, he clarified that covishield will not be changed to a single-shot schedule and there will be no mixing of vaccine jabs until scientifically proven.factchecker spoke to experts about the effectiveness of both these strategies.single-dose strategy the united kingdom recently reduced the gap between the two doses of the astrazeneca vaccine to eight weeks to ensure full protection. but, researchers from banaras hindu university claim that a single dose of the vaccine is effective for covid-19 recovered patients. bhu researchers studied both recovered and non-infected people and found that 90% of the non-infected people developed anti-bodies after 3-4 weeks but recovered people developed anti-bodies after first dose. ""by giving single-dose to recovered people we can overcome vaccine shortage. we've also written a letter to pm in this regard,"" gyaneshwer chaubey, a professor at bhu's zoology department, told ani.
 while only 90% of non-infected people developed antibodies after 3-4 weeks. recovered people developed antibodies after 1st dose. by giving single-dose to recovered people we can overcome vaccine shortage. we've also written a letter to pm in this regard: gyaneshwer chaubey pic.twitter.com/wuqoecgspaã ani up (@aninewsup) may 31, 2021 but experts absolutely disapprove of this strategy. ""the decision of altering the double dosed vaccine to single dosed is only meant to hide the shortage otherwise two doses are essential to provide complete immunity,"" said dr harjit bhatti, ex-president, aiims resident doctors' association and national president, progressive medicos and scientists forum.
  according to a study conducted by public health england (phe) and other institutions in england, a single-dose of the astra-zeneca vaccine in the united kingdom was only 33% effective in protecting from the b.1.617.2 coronavirus variant as compared to 59% efficacy from two doses of the vaccine. s vincent rajkumar, an oncologist and professor of medicine at the mayo clinic in the us, also called the strategy a ""bad idea"" in his recent tweet.
 if that's being considered, it's a bad idea. 1) see below. a single dose is insufficient protection. https://t.co/1muhcwds4lã vincent rajkumar (@vincentrk) may 31, 2021 while the popular comparison is drawn between single dose vaccines developed by johnson & johnson, sputnik light and oxford astra-zeneca developed covishield, experts believe effectiveness of vaccines on different variants needs to be paid attention to. ""johnson & johnson is a single dose vaccine and is an adeno-virus platform. but we do not how it performs against the b.1.617.2 variant. before we make a hasty decision to switch from two dose to one, we need to evaluate first as to how the vaccines are working with the variant. we have already got millions of people who have got one dose of the astra-zeneca vaccine with a time lag of one/two/three months after their first dose. but there is no evidence yet what the effectiveness of the vaccine is in such cases,"" dr gagandeep kang, a microbiologist, virologist and professor in christian medical college, vellore, told factchecker neither has the current situation of the variant been evaluated nor is it not known if the vaccine is working at all, she said. ""a decision certainly cannot be made without proper data just by saying that we are short of vaccines without taking into consideration of all the aspects,"" dr kang added. while seconding dr kang, dr jayadheer babu, a critical care specialist at guntur general hospital and state president of andhra pradesh government doctors' association, told factchecker, ""covishield, after first dose, has 30% efficacy and after 15 days of second dose it has an efficacy of 80-90%. so, the entire course of the vaccine is actually one and a half months and these issues with vaccines keep evolving. up until now we do not have any information on dose-wise antibody development and if at all there has been development of anti-bodies after the first dose, the research needs to be published, distributed and debated before coming up with the idea of single dose. only then we accept such a move."" mixing vaccines recently, 20 people in uttar pradesh's siddharthnagar district were accidentally given two different coronavirus jabs. they were given a shot of covishield in early april and later got the locally developed covaxin as part of their second dose in may. ""i have no problem with vaccine mixing but such mixings should not happen by accident the way it happened in uttar pradesh. people need to be recruited for such clinical trials with their consent where people know what and why are they recruited for the trial. this has to be conducted as a clinical trial before such practices are rolled out widely into the programme,"" dr kang told factchecker. experts are divided on this matter since some believe there isn't enough data to make such decisions. ""vaccine mixing is not ideal at this point since there is no data available yet to support such decisions,"" said dr babu. several countries are conducting studies on the mix and match of vaccines. in fact, spain and the united kingdom recently released the data from their trials which suggests that mixing may give higher antibody levels than two doses of the same vaccine. dr lalit kant, ex-deputy director general, indian council of medical research, said india should have studied this possibility long back. ""being the 'pharmacy of the world' comes with responsibilities of telling the world about all these aspects prior to others. we are doing too little and too late,"" he concluded."
2566,"india is reeling under the second wave of covid-19, for which it was infrastructurally and resource-wise unprepared for. the country reported more than four lakh cases on april 30, 2021, becoming the first country in the world to cross the four-lakh mark. and healthcare experts are already predicting that there'd be a third wave.
 dr devi shetty, noted cardiac surgeon and chairman, narayana health, recently said india should be prepared for a third wave and he suggested some solutions too. ""the current pandemic is likely to last for about 4 to 5 months. and then we should be prepared for the third wave,"" said dr shetty in an online address at the symbiosis golden jubilee lecture series.also, maharashtra chief minister uddhav thackeray told the state government to be prepared for a third wave of covid-19 in july or august this year.so, factchecker asked three public health experts what it is that they suggest india does to brace for the next wave. the responses ranged from strengthening the public healthcare workforce to a better supply chain and planning.health workforcein august 2020, the indian medical association president dr rajan sharma wrote to prime minister narendra modi demanding a national solatium for doctors. in the letter, he also cited that 87,000 healthcare workers were infected with the virus and 573 had died, according to government's data. in april 2021, a state-wise analysis by ima showed that 747 doctors in the country died of covid-19.""we need to produce at least two lakh nurses and at least one and a half lakh doctors in the next few weeks who are dedicated to managing covid for the next one year,"" said dr shetty.he suggested that the ministry of health along with the indian nursing council consider nursing students (general nursing and midwifery) as graduates, and deploy them to work in covid icu wards for one year.dr shahid jameel, virologist and director of the school of biosciences at ashoka university, seconded dr shetty and said, ""we should never again be caught with inadequate infrastructure (hospitals and doctors/hcws), poor supply chains (medicines, oxygen, etc) and most importantly, shoddy planning.""on may 3, 2021, the centre announced key decisions to boost availability of medical personnel to fight covid-19. one of the main decisions is to prioritise medical personnel completing 100 days of covid duty and to give them priority in forthcoming regular government recruitments. it has also been decided to deploy medical interns in covid-19 management duties under the supervision of their faculty.""the shortfall of doctors is about 33%, nurses 45%, beds 75%. so, our healthcare had been working sub-optimally even before the pandemic. while most modern nations have virtually eliminated the classical tropical infectious diseases, in india, such diseases clutter the healthcare institutions making even the time available for doctors per patient woefully just a few minutes only,"" dr t jacob john, virologist and former professor at the christian medical college, vellore told factchecker. ""moreover, doctors are not distributed evenly. five states with 30% of the total population have 50% doctors, leaving the rest of india grossly under-served,"" dr john added. highlighting how the well-being, especially mental health, of those who see so much sickness and death is also important, jameel said that if they are overworked, the quality of care goes down, which pushes up mortality.he suggested that to address this, the government should bring in retired doctors/healthcare workers and also deploy dentists, pharmacists and those training in alternative systems of medicine such as unani and ayurveda be given a short training in critical and supportive care. this would take the workload off those who are needed to care for the severely ill, explained jameel. scaling up vaccinationindia began its phased vaccination programme on january 16, 2021 targeting 300 million people. it was designed to first immunise vulnerable populations based on evidence from the first wave. this included nearly 10 million healthcare, 20 million frontline workers and 270 million people above the age of 50 (those with or without comorbidities).india has also exported about 64 million vaccine doses to 70 countries. according to a united nations (un) spokesperson, on april 28, 2021, india turned down un's offer of assistance from its integrated supply chain saying it has its own ""robust"" system to manage the logistics of getting material for dealing with the covid-19 surge.as on may 5, 2021, india has administered more than 16 crore vaccine doses in the country of which more than 13 crore were administered as first dose and over 3 crore as second dose.""vaccines are powerful tools. while vaccines would no longer help contain the current second wave because they take 6-8 weeks to show protection, they will reduce the intensity of future outbreaks,"" said dr jameel.""the task, therefore, is to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible. this requires proper planning to ensure adequate supplies, delivery points and effective communication. unfortunately, for reasons of hesitancy and poor communication, we lost valuable time in january and february when the daily caseload was reducing. now, it is an uphill battle,"" he added.dr giridhar babu, professor and head of life course epidemiology at the public health foundation of india told factchecker that a combination of high vaccine coverage and mitigation measures can prove helpful.""if we vaccinate a significant proportion of people and if we are careful about preventing it from the beginning then we could reduce the severity of the disease. vaccination coupled with control measures such as containment and mitigation strategies can prevent the third wave from being worse than the first two,"" he said.pandemic preparedness and mitigation planany temporary measure is futile without having a robust public health care system, say public health experts. dr john said we need to think politically about health.""we failed to plan and failed to meet the needs. india must shift national policy and establish universal healthcare, primary, secondary and tertiary without any more loss of time. the ruling party has the necessary majority to get reforms through rapidly. the ruling government's party must call all party meetings for consensus for spending 10% gdp, on health, on an expanding time schedule. half of that must be for establishing public health which we have neglected for more than 70 years,"" the vellore-based virologist explained.another highlight is not forgetting health and wellness centres in urban areas. the phfi professor suggested that there should be at least one such centre per 5,000 people with additional doctors and nurses in urban areas to promote primary healthcare so people don't have to rely on costly health services.""when there is an earthquake, we have a disaster mitigation plan. but in a pandemic, we still don't have a robust plan in dealing with a health emergency,"" said dr babu.""this crisis cannot be dealt with by increasing the capacity of health workers alone. we can't create four to five lakh workers just like that. hence, we need to redistribute and use our complete workforce. this will not end with the third wave in india and therefore the day when the cases start rising we need to immediately plan on imposing lockdowns, reduce movement and use the workforce in an efficient manner. we should not be caught by surprise again,"" he added. can a covid-19 third wave be prevented?when asked this, experts told factchecker that a third covid-19 wave is unavoidable but that it can be delayed and reduced in severity.""based on what we have seen so far, a third wave is unavoidable. but we cannot say if it would be better or worse than the current one. that will depend upon how many people get infected and vaccinated during the next few months. the severity will depend also on how prepared we are with medical infrastructure and supply chains,"" said dr jameel.he highlighted how the severity of this wave is not because the virus has become more lethal, but because it has become more infectious and transmissible. and a solution to it is tracking emerging viral variants that can compromise preparations. ""we know and can deal with what is currently contributing to the second wave. but more infectious and/or more lethal variants can easily change the future course. for this, it is important to sequence viruses in the population at sufficient density, and pay attention to what is emerging,"" dr jameel ended."
2567,"several news headlines for over a month have read like ""cases of mucormycosis or black fungus"". in fact, many ministers too have been equating mucormycosis with black fungus as the infection surged during the second wave of covid-19. for example, maharashtra chief minister uddhav thackeray recently tweeted, ""the state has around 3,000 patients with mucormycosis or black fungus."" but are the terms interchangeable? according to experts, calling mucormycosis 'black fungus' is a misnomer because the infection is not a recent phenomenon. factchecker spoke to dr manish munjal, an ent specialist at sir ganga ram hospital in new delhi, and dr ishwar gilada, an infectious diseases expert, president of the aids society of india and governing council member of international aids society, to understand the difference between the two fungal diseases.what is mucormycosis?mucormycosis, previously called zygomycosis, is rare and invasive and a non-fungal infection caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes. these molds live throughout the environment and enter the body through nasal passages. ""mucormycosis is an opportunistic fungal infection. it happens when there is a compromised host immunity. earlier, it used to infect people with hiv, cancer and those who had a liver transplant but it was quite infrequent; around two or three cases in a big hospital like gangaram in a month. it was still deadly but we had the means to treat them. but it wasn't as high in density as it is currently,"" dr munjal told factchecker. what is the difference between mucormycosis and black fungus?according to both the doctors, the main difference is in the actual colour of the fungus and the colour of the tissue.""mucormycosis is not actually black. the fungus does not derive its name from the colour of its filaments which is the fungi itself but due to the blackening it causes on the host body it infects. the tissue becomes dark and then the skin inside the nose or the scab that forms is almost black in colour,"" said dr munjal.""in medieval times, people associated the bubonic plague with black death. the colour of the tissue governed the name of the disease. so, when we say yellow fever, the virus is not yellow. it's the colour of the pigment, not the virus,"" he added.it is neither a new disease and nor does the fungus have a colour when looked at through a microscopic lens. it's the dead tissue that turns black. ""there are fungi of different colours. for example, candida is white. similarly, there are brown, grey, black, orange and yellow fungi. but the colour of mucormycosis is not black. the term which is being currently used is a misnomer,"" said dr gilada.""it's better to call it mucor. it's called black fungus because it is caused in the nasal area where an ulcer is formed. later, the ulcer becomes necros or a dead tissue which is black in colour. hence, it's called black fungus but the fungus is not black in colour, it's the skin that becomes black. under the microscope, mucormycosis does not really have a colour,"" explained the infectious diseases expert.in fact, aiims director randeep guleria, in a press conference on may 24, 2021, asked the media to refrain from labelling the fungus with different colours as it could create confusion. ""black fungus is another family; this term got associated with mucormycosis due to the presence of black dots among the culture of white fungal colonies. in general, there are various types of fungal infections such as candida, aspergillosis, cryptococcus, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. mucormycosis, candida and aspergillus are the ones observed more in those with low immunity,"" said dr guleria at the press briefing.
 
 dr sp kalantri, professor of medicine at the mahatma gandhi institute of medical sciences and medical superintendent of kasturba hospital, sevagram, also highlighted how both terms are not the same. he tweeted, ""the fungus is not black. the tissues it destroys turn black."" before the second wave, covid-19-associated invasive fungal infections were also reported during april 2020 in india. these infections have also been reported during previous epidemics such as sars in 2003.mucormycosis is lethal and is fatal for people whose immune system is already low. deaths due to the fungal infection in previous coronavirus outbreaks such as sars ranged from 25% to 73%. but this infection is not a recent phenomenon.""all our knowledge that we have employed in treating covid patients with mucormycosis stems from the experience of treating the same infection in the past. the antifungal infections in the market are from mucormycosis only,"" said infectious diseases expert dr gilada. although technically incorrect, experts believe the correlation between the infection and the colour has resulted in more awareness and early treatment of patients. when asked if associating fungal infections with colour codes is incorrect, dr munjal said, ""medically it should be avoided, but it has also been a great tool in educating people. many have been able to reach centers fast and have led to people getting themselves treated at a much higher rate as compared to before. i am happy to say that some have been treated within a week which was almost unheard of previously. that is because they could associate the symptoms with the black word. if you give medical jargon to it, it might not be able to catch the imagination of the public."" while highlighting who are more at risk against the disease, the experts said the vulnerable section are the ones who have diabetes. ""these covid patients were given steroids, antibiotics and because of this, their sugar levels were high and were untreated for a long time. they were in isolation centres and hospitals. this is when the fungus got a chance to enter the nasal oxygen cannulas, pipes, and contaminated hands. this is still worrisome and if there ever is a third wave we must make sure it does not happen again,"" warned dr munjal.why the surge of mucormycosis cases during second wave?there are 19,727 active cases of mucormycosis across the country, according to an affidavit filed by deputy drugs controller rubina bose of central drugs standard control organisation on behalf of the central government in bombay high court on june 2, 2021. increase in symptomatic patients, use of steroids and people needing help of oxygen cylinders were cases behind the surge in cases.""in the second wave, there were more symptomatic patients than the first wave, so more people were hospitalised. steroids were used in more people too, especially for those with diabetes which reduced their immunity significantly. when the immunity goes down the body immediately catches bacteria, fungus or parasite,"" said dr gilada.""more people needed oxygen in the second wave and oxygen goes through a tube which goes to a bottle which uses water. it's called a humidifier. the water or the tube can be the source of fungus. suppose we keep food outside for three or four days, it catches fungus. we can say that the body is like a sack of sugar which the fungus is attracted to,"" he explained.prevention in terms of covid-19 management, doctors should be very careful in scrutinising the stage of the infection. nothing should be done to decrease the immunity of the person, munjal said. the experts listed the following practices that can help prevent people from getting the infection:1.antibiotics, steroids and antiviral drugs should not be used unnecessarily. suppose the patient is losing oxygen or the fever refuses to go down after eight or nine days, doctors should carefully evaluate such patients and administer steroids under a monitored dosage system. 2.sugar levels should be carefully monitored as well so that the immune system does not weaken.3.there should be extra effort in maintaining hygiene. a nose saline spray and mouthwash should be kept handy.4. hospital and home equipment used to administer the nasal cannulas, oxygen moisturizing systems should be totally sterilised."
2575,"on january 2, 2021, union information and broadcasting minister prakash javadekar said that india was probably the only country where four different vaccines were being made ready. the drugs controller general of india (dcgi), on january 3, cleared the way for serum institute of india's covishield and bharat biotech's covaxin for 'restricted use', making it the first vaccines approved to be used against covid-19 in the country. however, while making his claim on vaccines, the union minister failed to mention whether these vaccine candidates were solely manufactured in india or if it was indigenously produced, developed and made in the country.
 at present, there are nine covid-19 vaccine candidates in different phases of development in india, of which two have already received the green signal for restricted use. of the four vaccines mentioned by the union minister, only two, covaxin and zycov d are indigenously produced. the remaining two have been developed (invented) in other countries but are being manufactured in india. overall, there are four vaccine candidates which are indigenously produced.
  vaccines produced indigenously in india 1. bharat biotech: covaxin hyderabad-based bharat biotech has developed an inactivated sars-cov-2 vaccine in collaboration with indian council of medical research (icmr) and national institute of virology (niv). it is the first indigenous vaccine to be approved for restricted use in an emergency situation. the vaccine is developed on vero cell platform, which has been widely accepted by regulatory authorities and has been used for over 30 years for the production of polio and rabies virus vaccines. the company has generated safety and immunogenicity data in animal species such as mice, rats, rabbits, syrian hamsters and has also conducted challenge studies on non-human primates (rhesus macaques) and hamsters.
 according to a press release on january 3, 2021, phase ? and phase ? clinical trials were conducted in approximately 800 subjects. the third phase of clinical trials saw over 25,000 participants. since the vaccine is still in its third phase, experts have raised questions on the emergency authorization of the vaccine mainly due to the absence of efficacy data. the all india drug action network, an independent network of several non government organisations on drug policy said that the decision to approve an incompletely studied vaccine raises more questions than answers. however, krishna ella, the director of bharat biotech has stated that the efficacy data for the vaccine will be provided by february, 2020, immediately after the completion of the phase three trials.
  2. zydus cadila: zycov d ahmedabad-based zydus cadila has developed zycov-d with national biopharma mission (nbm) and the department of biotechnology, government of india. it is india's first indigenously developed dna vaccine candidate against covid-19 and has received the green signal by the dcgi for conducting the phase ? trials. over 1,000 volunteers participated in the phase ? / ? clinical trials of this vaccine. the interim data shows that the vaccine is safe and immunogenic when three doses were administered intradermally. the third phase of clinical trials will be conducted on 26,000 indian participants.
  3. gennova biopharmaceuticals: mrna india's first indigenous mrna vaccine, developed by pune-based gennova pharmaceuticals in collaboration with hdt biotech corporation, usa, has received permission from indian drug regulators to initiate the first two phases of human clinical trials on december 11, 2020.. according to an official statement, the mrna vaccines are fully synthetic and do not require a host for growth, e.g., eggs or bacteria. this means it can be swiftly manufactured in an inexpensive manner under cgmp (current good manufacturing practices) conditions to ensure their availability and accessibility for mass vaccinations. the vaccine is stable at 2-8 degrees celsius for two months
  4. biological e: antigen vaccine hyderabad-based biological e started its phase ?/? clinical trials to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity in november 2020 itself. the firm is expected to produce its interim data within the first quarter of this year. this vaccine candidate, which has received seed funding from the department of biotechnology, uses an antigen licenced from baylor college of medicine in houston, texas and an adjuvant (an ingredient used in some vaccines to create a stronger immune response) from dynavax technologies corporation. potential advantages of this vaccine include scalability and thermostability. this could make it fit for deployment at scale in low-resource settings.
  non-indigenous vaccines 1. serum institute of india: covishield covishield, developed at the jenner institute, university of oxford in the uk and licenced from british pharmaceutical company astrazeneca received the indian government's approval for restricted use of the vaccine on january 3, 2021. the pune-based serum institute uses a non replicating chimpanzee adenovirus as a vector. the vaccine attacks the spike protein of sars-cov-2.
 oxford-astrazeneca submitted safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data generated on 23,745 participants aged â³ 18 years or older from overseas clinical studies, showing an overall efficacy of 70.42%. in terms of indian studies, 1,600 participants took part in the second and third phase of the clinical trials and the data from this trial was found comparable and 'noninferior' to the uk product.
  2. dr reddy's laboratories: sputnik v named after the first soviet space satellite, the russian vaccine sputnik v is developed by gamaleya institute and russian direct investment fund. in india, the vaccine is being manufactured at dr reddy's laboratories and has shown 95% efficacy in its interim analysis. the vaccine is currently in its third phase of clinical trial. sputnik v is the world's first registered vaccine and is rooted on a adenoviral (most common vector used for cancer gene therapy) vector-based platform.
 3. serum institute of india: novavax
 usa-based novavax which is manufactured by serum institute of india is a protein based vaccine which in under consideration by the indian government for its phase ? clinical trial. the vaccine is currently in its third phase of clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in the usa and mexico.
 4.biological e: johnson & johnson adenoviral vaccine
 apart from signing up with baylor college of medicine for its antigen vaccine, biological e also entered into an agreement with johnson & johnson unit janssen pharmaceutica to manufacture its covid-19 candidate in india. as of december 28, 2020, the vaccine is in its pre-clinical stages.
 the us-based pharmaceutical company pfizer has not yet turned up for cdsco's committee meetings to deliberate on the approval process despite applying to the dcgi for permission for emergency use of the vaccine. besides, pfizer is yet to generate data from local clinical trials in india and will be relying on data from other countries."
